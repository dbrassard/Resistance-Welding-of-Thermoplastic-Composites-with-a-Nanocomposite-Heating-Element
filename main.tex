							\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Composite materials and weight reduction of structures in transport \cite{FordMotorLLC2018}, aeronautic, aerospace... (ADD REFERENCES)

Demand for thermoplastic composites driven by their higher impact resistance, shorter cycle times, recyclability and higher environmental resistance \cite{cogswell1992}

Resistance welding of composite as a cost/weight effective solution for joining thermoplastic composites
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction in the eighties with carbon fibre heating elements \cite{houghton1984bonding} and \cite{Eveno1988} 
	\item Evaluation of the welding parameters \cite{Ageorges2000a}
	\item Issues with carbon fiber heating elements \cite{McKnight1997}
	\item Stainless steel heating elements as an alternative (SS mesh)\cite{Hou1999a}, (parameters investigation)\cite{Dube2007}, (mesh size effect)\cite{Dube2012a}, (process optimization through simulation)\cite{Talbot2013}, (parameters investigation)\cite{Shi2014} and (continuous process)\cite{Shi2015a} 
	\item Poor adhesion to the mesh
\end{enumerate}

Traditionnal resistance welding is a well established process but we believe that it is interesting to investigate alternative heating elements 

Also, there is a need in the market for alternative welding process to match varied applications requirements. \cite{CompositeWorldSloan2018}

Conductive nanocomposite as poor conductor -> good resistance
