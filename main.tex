							\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The weight of structural elements has a strong impact on the efficiency and cost of transportation. 
Our increasing reliance on space technologies and the need to reduce the price of sending cargo into orbit are pushing the field of aerospace to reduce costs by implementing carbon composite structures \cite{Williams2003,Timmis2015}. 
More and more, fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) are being employed to produce lightweight structural elements to meet those needs. 

Thermoset composites are dominating the market for high-performance FRP, but thermoplastic composites are seeing an upward trend \cite{CompositeWorldSloan2018}. 
This demand for thermoplastic composites is driven by their higher impact resistance, increased production rates, superior recyclability and higher environmental resistance \cite{cogswell1992}. 
A distinct advantage of thermoplastics over thermosets is their ability to join components via welding instead of using adhesives or mechanical fasteners. 

Different welding processes were developed for different applications and joint geometry. 
Resistance welding, induction welding, ultrasonic welding and laser welding are a few of the welding processes under development for joining thermoplastic composites. 
The main divergence between these processes is in the way heat is generated. 
To weld the adherents (the contacting parts to join together) with the resistance welding process (Fig. \ref{fig:welding_jig_schematic}), heat is generated by a porous heating element located at the weld interface and connected to a power source. 
An electrical current is applied to generate heat at the weld line. 
The connection between the power supply and the heating element is generally established by copper connectors which are clamped at a predetermined distance from the sides of the adherents (the so-called “clamping distance”). 
During the welding process, pressure is applied to the weld stack to achieve intimate contact between the adherents and to promote autohesion during the melt and consolidation phases. 

Resistance welding is a well-established process to join high performance thermoplastic composites. 
It is considered as a low cost and weight-effective solution to assemble complex light-weight parts. 
Initial developments involved the use of carbon fibre as heating elements \cite{Ageorges2000a,houghton1984bonding,Eveno1988}. 
Nevertheless, weld uniformity and electrical connections with the carbon fibres were problematic and caused scaling issues \cite{McKnight1997}. 
To solve these issues, researchers switched to stainless steel meshes heating elements. 
Those were found to increase the reliability of the process \cite{Hou1999a}. 
The effects of parameters such as the clamping distance, the geometry of the electrodes (square ended electrodes or with a resin fillet) or the signal function for the voltage of the source (ramp or step) were studied \cite{Dube2007}. 
Other effects such as pressure on the weld and moisture content in the laminates also need to be considered to obtain good welds \cite{Shi2014}. 
A tight control of the whole process is required to transition from a single step weld to continuous welding \cite{Shi2015a}. 

Single lap shears (SLS) values are commonly reported to evaluate the performance of welding parameters. 
Common failure modes in SLS tests, for samples welded with stainless steel heating element under suboptimal conditions, are adhesive failure (ADH) between the mesh and the polymer or between the polymer and the adherents. 
These failures can be accompanied with tearing of the mesh. 
Under good welding conditions, light-fiber-tear failure (LFT) often accompanied by mesh tearing is observed \cite{Shi2014}. 
Additionally, under cyclic loading, due to low interfacial bonding, stainless steel meshes contribute to crack initiation and propagation from peel stress at the edge of laminates \cite{Dube2009a}. 
Poor bonding between the polymer and the stainless steel mesh is a well-documented limitation of traditional resistance welding \cite{Dube2007,Dube2012a,Dube2009a,Shi2014,Shi2015a}. 
An increase in the ratio of open area to the wire size of the mesh, to a certain extent, improves SLS results by allowing more polymer chains to sustain the stress. 
Taking that optimization to its limit leads to a weld interface without any wire similar to compression moulding \cite{Dube2012a}. 

Taking the stainless steel heating element, which acts as a foreign inclusion, out of the process could lead to improved mechanical performance. 
In addition, we need a heating element that would also be compatible with the polymer of the adherents to improve the interfacial bonding of the joint. 
A polymer-based nanocomposite heating element could play that role and serve as a replacement for stainless steel meshes. 
Here, we propose to develop a conductive polymer nanocomposite to be used as a heating element for resistance welding of high performance thermoplastic composites. 

Conductive nanocomposites are formed by combining a polymer matrix with conductive nanoparticles (typically composed of metal or carbon). 
They can take shapes ranging from platelets, spheres or tubes and their size goes from the micrometre scale down to nanometre sized particles. 
Copper and silver nanowires \cite{Gelves2008a, Al-Saleh2011, Li2015a, Riviere2016}, carbon black \cite{Jin2013, MohdRadzuan2017}, graphene \cite{Jiang2012a, Hu2014a} and carbon nanotubes \cite{Diez-Pascual2011,Huegun2013,Kazakova2014,Jia2015} are a few of the commonly used particles to synthesize conductive polymer composites.

The electrical properties of nanocomposites depend, among other things, on the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles, their mass fraction, surface treatments they have received and the mixing method. 
This was illustrated by Bauhofer et al., who showed that even with the same kinds of particles, differences in their manufacturing processes can produce variations of the nanocomposite properties \cite{Bauhofer2009}. 
Thus the composition and manufacturing process for a nanocomposite needs to be tailored for its application. 

Traditional metallic heating elements such as Nichrome, or stainless steel in the case of resistance welding, relies on their relatively low (for metals) electrical conductivity (\num{6.7e3} and \SI{14.5e3}{\siemens\per\centi\metre} respectively) to produce heat through the Joule effect. 
Although the electrical conductivity of conductive nanocomposites is much lower than usual values for conductors (up to \SI{10}{\siemens\per\centi\metre} \cite{Grossiord2008a}, they are able to generate controllable localized heating \cite{Pyo2016}. 

For traditional resistance welding of high performance thermoplastic composites parts made of carbon fibre and poly(ether ether ketone) (CF/PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI) is commonly used to provide a resin-rich region to prevent current leakage through the composite. 
The miscibility of PEI in PEEK \cite{Crevecoeur1991} also improves the bonding between the adherents to reach good mechanical performances. 
By using the same polymer, for the matrix of the nanocomposite, we hypothesize that we could take advantage of that miscibility and obtain a nanocomposite heating element suitable for resistance welding of PEEK/CF laminates. 
This novel heating element would be almost entirely miscible within the matrix of the composite and would not leave foreign objects in the weld. 

We will demonstrate that conductive nanocomposite heating elements are suitable replacements to stainless steel meshes for resistance welding of high performance thermoplastic composites. The core phenomena will be validated through simulations and laboratory experiments. This new heating element will then be used to join high performance thermoplastic composite adherents in a resistance welding jig.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Simulations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Finite element models were developed using COMSOL Mul\-ti\-phy\-sics\-\textregistered software to evaluate the contribution of the three main heating mechanisms inside the nanocomposite heating element and verify that the polymer will not undergo thermal degradation.  
A set of three continuum micromechanic models presenting different contact topologies assessed the relative contribution of each heating mechanism to the global heating phenomena within a conductive nanocomposite. 
Representative elementary volume (REV) were used in these models (Fig. \ref{fig:geometry}). 
A constant mass fraction of 1\% MWCNTs was kept between the models as a means to define their dimensions and to serve as comparison point. 

In the first model, a single multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) (Fig. \ref{fig:geometry_axisymmetric} dark zone), surrounded by polymer (Fig. \ref{fig:geometry_axisymmetric} white zone) was represented using axisymmetric boundary conditions. 
The top and bottom surfaces of the MWCNT acted as voltage source and ground, respectively, with the current flowing through the MWCNT. 
The diameter of the MWCNT was set to \SI{12}{\nano\metre} in agreement with the data obtained from our supplier. 
This model assumed heat generation through Joule effect inside the MWCNT and heat transfer by conduction occurring radially from the MWCNT to the polymer.

	\label{fig:geometry}
\end{figure}

In the second model, the flow of the current has to cross through direct contact between adjacent nanotubes. 
The REV (Fig. \ref{fig:geometry_3D}) includes three MWCNTs (dark region) that form a percolated electrical path within the polymer matrix. 
The current from the voltage source must transfer through two contact point interfaces to reach the ground on the other side of the conductive network. 
The highlighted plane shows the area of interest for temperature monitoring. 
Joule heating from within the MWCNTs was also present in this model. 

In the third model, the current was forced to flow through the polymer between two adjacent MWCNTs. 
In this REV, a gap of variable length was introduced between the ends of two conductive MWCNTs (Fig. \ref{fig:geometry_gap}). 
This gap forced the flow of the current to travel through the polymer.  

In each simulation, a constant DC electric field was applied for \SI{5}{\second} and the resulting temperature field was recorded. 
The value of the electric field was adjusted so as to reach similar temperatures after \SI{5}{\second} in all three models. 
A volumetric electromagnetic heat sources was used to simulate Joule heating. 
Conductive heat transfer within solids (Fourier's law) is considered and the current is conserved within the elementary volume (conservation law). 
Electrical insulation and symmetric thermal boundary conditions were set for the edges of the polymer matrix that were not in contact with the MWCNT. 
Symmetric thermal boundary conditions were defined at both ends of the MWCNT. 
These boundary conditions were selected to simulate a REV far from the outer surfaces of the nanocomposite heating element. 
Under these conditions, heat was generated within the three models but had no way to exit, causing the temperature to increase as energy kept accumulating.

The physical properties of PEEK were used for the polymer matrix alongside physical properties for MWCNT taken from the literature (Tab. \ref{tab:material_properties}).

\subsection{Materials}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Polymers and Nanocomposite}

The polymer materials were PEEK (CAS 29658-26-2) and PEI (CAS 61128-46-9) pellets ordered from Sigma Aldrich. 
PEEK pellets had an average molecular weight by mass ($M_w$) of \SI{20,8}{\kilo\gram\per\mol} and an average molecular mass by number ($M_n$) of \SI{10,3}{\kilo\gram\per\mol} and PEI pellets had a melt index of \SI{18}{\gram} per \SI{10}{\minute} at \SI{337}{\celsius} with a mass of \SI{6.6}{\kilogram}. 

The conductive nanoparticles consisted of dry powdered MWCNTs, produced by combustion chemical vapour deposition (CCVD), purchased from Raymor Industries. 
They had outer diameters in the range of \SIrange{10}{20}{\nano\metre}, lengths from \SIrange{1}{12}{\micro\metre} and purity of at least 99\%.

The nanocomposites were produced with a DSM Xplore \SI{5}{cc} twin screw micro compounder. 
Polymer pellets were introduced along with the MWCNTs and internally mixed by the recirculation circuit. 
The resulting batches of extruded wires were cut into small pellets, mixed thoroughly and fed a second time to obtain a uniform composition. 
The PEI and PEEK nanocomposites were respectively processed at \SIlist{340;390}{\celsius}. 
A nanocomposite wire extruded from the micro compounder with a die diameter of \SI{1}{\milli\metre} was used as is for the PEEK nanocomposite wire, with a 16\% mass fraction of MWCNTs. 
The extruded wires were cut into pellets prior further processing. 
Flat PEI nanocomposite heating elements, with a 10\% mass fraction of MWCNTs, were produced by hot pressing pellets into \SI{0.5}{\milli\metre} thick films and cutting them into rectangles of \SI{12.7 x 55}{\milli\metre}. 
The electrical conductivity of the PEI nanocomposite, at 5\%, 10\% and 15\% mass fraction of MWCNTs, was measured with the four-point probe technique. 

\subsubsection{Composite}

The thermoplastic composite adherents were produced by hot pressing CF/PEEK pre-impregnated plies to form unidirectional composite laminates and cutting them to dimensions (\SI{25.4 x 101.6}{\milli\metre} ), with an abrasive saw, according to ASTM D5868 - 01(2014). 

In agreement with the supplier’s recommendations, the stacks of plies were heated to \SI{390}{\celsius} under a pressure of \SI{0.25}{\MPa}. 
The pressure was then increased to \SI{2}{\MPa} for \SI{30}{\minute} to consolidate the laminate before cooling it back to room temperature. 
The pressure was maintained during the cooling phase. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Preliminary Experiments}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Prior to the welding tests, a simple small-scale validation of the heating elements was devised. 
A \SI{1}{\milli\metre} PEEK wire, approximately \SI{80}{\milli\metre} long, was attached to an adjustable AC power source. 
Five different voltages (from \SIrange{10}{50}{\volt}) were applied to the sample to obtain five different power levels. 
Tests were conducted under a fume hood. 
The voltage and current were measured once the temperature at the surface of the wire reached steady state. 
The value of the electric field was obtained by dividing the voltage from the source by the length of the wire between the electrical connectors. 
A FLIR T420 infrared camera was used to record the surface temperature distribution. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Welding Experiments}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A computer controlled resistance welding jig was built to weld single lap shear test samples with an overlap of \SI{12.7}{\milli\metre} and a width of \SI{25.4}{\milli\metre} (Fig. \ref{fig:welding_jig}). 
Two square copper electrodes with sides of \SI{12.7}{\milli\metre} were used to connect the power source to the nanocomposite heating element. 
Three pneumatic actuators applied constant pressure over the electrodes and the welded zone while the nanocomposite was kept between two composite adherents surrounded by \SI{12.7}{\milli\metre} thick alumina silicate ceramic insulating blocks. 
The section of the nanocomposite heating element outside of the welded zone, on each sides (Fig. \ref{fig:location_thermocouple}), where the electrodes were connected, rested flat on the insulating blocks on each sides of the weld. 
The clamping distances, on each sides of the adherent, between the faces of the electrodes and the sides of the adherent were adjusted for each test. 
Electrical power was supplied by a \SI{10}{\kW} programmable DC power source series XR from Magna-Power capable of providing up to \SI{160}{\volt} and \SI{60}{\ampere}. 
The power source can be driven as a constant voltage source, constant current source or with custom power profiles. 
A modulation scheme was configured to allow the source to operate with a constant power output. 
In this mode of operation, the source adjusts its output current based on the voltage applied and keep a constant power output disregarding variations in the resistance of the heating element.

\end{figure}

For the welding experiments, electrical parameters were set so as to closely mimic conditions that are observed during traditional resistance welding of thermoplastic composites. 
The initial voltage setting for constant voltage operation was calculated based on a specific power of \SI{350}{\kW\per\square\metre} and the electrical resistance of the heating element. 

Prior to welding, the surfaces of the adherents and the nanocomposite were thoroughly cleaned with acetone to remove any traces of residue or release agent. 
PEI nanocomposite heating elements were installed between the composite adherents. 
Tabs on both ends were left to connect the electrodes, they were laying flat on ceramic insulator blocks while the pneumatic actuators pushed the copper electrodes against them. 
A contact pressure of 2.4 MPa was applied by the electrodes over a square area with \SI{12.7}{\milli\metre} sides. 
Over the weld, a third actuator applied a constant pressure of \SI{1}{\MPa} during the whole welding process. 
It was previously demonstrated, for traditional resistance welding, that pressures close to \SI{1}{\MPa} are able to produce welds with good mechanical properties by promoting intimate contact, necessary for polymer chain transfers at interfaces, while preventing void formation due to excessive polymer flow out of the weld \cite{Ageorges2000a, Dube2007, Shi2014}. 
Type K thermocouples, located on the ceramic above the welded zone, monitored the temperature during the welding process (Fig. \ref{fig:location_thermocouple}). 
The thermocouples could not be installed directly on the nanocomposite heating element as their presence altered the heat transfer mechanisms within the weld. 
The first thermocouple was located slightly off centre at \SI{14}{\milli\metre} from the side of the adherent at the centreline of the overlap. 
The second thermocouple was also located on the centreline but \SI{2.5}{\milli\metre} away from the side of the adherent.

		}
		\caption{Location of the thermocouples during the welding process}
		\label{fig:location_thermocouple}
\end{figure} 

Beside the operating mode for the power source, the electrode distance from the side of the laminate and the duration of the welding process were the main factors taken into account during the welding tests. 
The resistance of each weld was evaluated with a single lap shear (SLS) test as per ASTM D5868 – 01(2014) with an MTS Alliance RF/200 testing machine. 
Subsequently, fractography analysis was carried out with ImageJ. 
In this analysis, dividing the area of the welded zone by the total area gave the percentage of welded area. 
Both sides of the fracture specimens were evaluated to get an average measure for each sample. 
The failure modes obtained were classified and reported as per ASTM D5573 – 99(2012).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{FTIR Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

FTIR spectra were collected to validate the absence of thermal degradation induced by the welding process. 
A Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer and a iD5 ATR Accessory were used to collect spectra from the virgin PEI pellets, PEI nanocomposite films before welding and PEI nanocomposite on the fracture surface after SLS tests. 
Spectra for CF/PEEK adherents were also collected to serve as reference.

\end{figure}

As expected, simulations from the first FEM show resistive heat generated only within the MWCNT (Fig. \ref{fig:heat_axysymmetric}). 
Current went through the conductive MWCNT and thermal conduction caused the heating of the polymer. 
A homogeneous temperature of \SI{217}{\celsius} is obtained for this simulation after \SI{5}{\second} under an electric field of \SI{100}{\volt\per\metre}. 

\subsubsection{Contact Resistance Heat Generation}

For the second FEM, the primary heat source was located at the contact point between the MWCNTs (Fig. \ref{fig:heat_3D}). 
Contribution from Joule heating within the MWCNTs was also present in the model with a power density 4 orders of magnitude lower. 
A uniform temperature profile is seen in MWCNTs, which is due to their high thermal conductivity. 
A uniform temperature of \SI{141}{\celsius} is obtained for this simulation after \SI{5}{\second} under an electric field of \SI{100}{\volt\per\metre}.

In the third FEM, heat generation occurred almost exclusively in the polymer matrix (Fig. \ref{fig:result_gap_power}). 
Heat is generated in the bulk of the polymer and a uniform temperature profile is obtained in the model (Fig. \ref{fig:result_gap_temp}). 

\FloatBarrier

The third model demonstrates that the electric field required to reach a temperature similar to that of the first two models increases sharply when a small gap is introduced in the conductive network (Fig. \ref{fig:result_gap_temp}). 
A gap of \SI{0.1}{\nano\metre}, between adjacent MWCNTs, required a field of \SI{3.1e9}{\volt\per\metre} to produce a temperature of \SI{170}{\celsius} (Fig. \ref{fig:result_gap01nm_temp}). 
When the gap was increased to \SI{8}{\nano\metre} a field of \SI{15e9}{\volt\per\metre} was necessary (Fig. \ref{fig:result_gap8nm_temp}). 
These electrical field strengths are above the dielectric strength of PEEK (\SI{1.2e9}{\volt\per\metre}) and the current went through the bulk of the polymer matrix. 
That seven order of magnitude increase in the electrical field, when a gap is introduced, confirms that the third heating mode  is unlikely to happen in practical applications. 
A connected network of MWCNTs provides pathways of lower resistance for the electrons to flow. 
A sharp increase in the resistance is indicative of a perturbation in the percolated network. 

From these results, we can observe that conduction (and thus heat dissipation) within MWCNTs and through their contact points is the main driver for heat generation within a nanocomposite heating element. 
The uniform temperature fields observed lead to the conclusion that under normal operating conditions, no thermal degradation should occur within the nanocomposite during the welding process. 
A comparative numerical analysis of the timescales for thermal diffusion, validating the uniform temperature fields observed in the models, is presented in the supplementary information.

The electrical parameters and maximum temperature at the surface of a nanocomposite filament once steady state is reached are presented in Table \ref{tab:results_lab}.

As expected, an increase of the electric field produces higher surface temperatures with higher currents flowing through the sample. 
Under an electric field of 700 \SI{700}{\V\per\m}, the wire reached a surface temperature of \SI{190}{\celsius} after \SI{5}{\s} (Fig. \ref{fig:results_thermal}), corresponding to a heating rate of \SI{33}{\celsius\per\s} (Fig. \ref{fig:temp_over_time}). 
Although a higher electrical field was required than in the simulations (\SI{700}{\V\per\m} vs \SI{100}{\V\per\m}), the small-scale experiments produced uniform heating at the surface of the nanocomposite wire. 
It is also possible to verify, from the heating rate ($\dot{T}$) (in \si{\celsius}) and the material properties (Tab. \ref{tab:material_properties}), that the specific thermal power (in \si{\W\per\cubic\m}) dissipated by the nanocomposite is in agreement with the specific electrical power measured (Eq. \ref{eq:specific_power}).  

\begin{equation}
P_{specific} = \rho \ C_p \ \dot{T}
\label{eq:specific_power}
\end{equation}

A density of \SI{1410}{\kg\per\cubic\m} and a specific heat of \SI{1730}{\joule\per\kg\per\celsius} are estimated, using the mixing rule. 
This results in a specific thermal power of \SI{80}{\W\per\cubic\cm} that is similar to the specific electrical powers in the last lines of Tab. \ref{tab:results_lab}.

\subsection{Welding Experiments}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Nanocomposite Heating Elements}

Initially, a nanocomposite with 16\% weight fraction of MWCNTs and a matrix composed of PEEK was produced for the for the small scale demonstration of resistance heating with a nanocomposite filament. 
PEEK was initially chosen for its high melting temperature and good thermal stability. 
For the heating element of the welding experiments, a PEI matrix was instead used.  
This transition is expected to help in achieving welding at lower temperatures as with the Thermabond process. 
The electrical conductivity of PEI nanocomposites with 5\%, 10\% and 15\% mass fractions of MWCNTs was measured at respectively of \SIlist[multi-part-units = single]{0.27(08);0.79(06);0.92(30)}{\siemens\per\cm}. 
It was decided that the marginal gain in conductivity between 10\% and 15\% mass fraction of MWCNTs was not worth the increased cost and production problems associated with high particle loading. 
PEI nanocomposite films with 10\% mass fraction of MWCNTs were used as heating elements during the welding tests. 

\subsubsection{Constant power welding}
\FloatBarrier

Operation under constant voltage conditions achieved poor reproducibility between initial welding tests and was not investigated further. 
Operation under constant power yielded significant improvements in the welding results consistency. 
Tests were carried out at a specific power of \SI{350}{\kW\per\square\metre} with a constant pressure of \SI{1}{\MPa} on the weld. 
Clamping distances of \SIlist{0;1;1.5}{\mm} and welding times of \SIlist{60;70;90;120}{\s} were investigated. 
Three samples were produced for each welding condition. 
The results for SLS tests along with the average fraction of welded areas are reported in Table \ref{tab:SLS_and_fractography_results}.

Cohesive failure within the nanocomposite with some adhesive failure on the edges of the heating element was the primary mode of rupture observed for samples welded under constant power with unidirectional adherents. 
Samples welded for \SI{60}{\s} with a clamping distance of \SI{1.5}{\mm} presented a higher fraction of adhesive failure. 
The zone where cohesive failure is observed had an hourglass shape with a thinner width at the centre of the weld (Fig. \ref{fig:fracture_surface_70s}). 
For welding times of \SI{90}{\s} and longer, the hourglass shape is absent from the results and only cohesive failure of the nanocomposite is present (Fig. \ref{fig:fracture_surface_90s}).

Temperature monitoring during the welding process of a sample with an electrode gaps of \SI{1.5}{\mm} showed some temperature variations between the centre and the side of the weld (Fig. \ref{fig:temp_350kW_120_10_150_3UD}).
It was previously demonstrated that the clamping distance has a major impact on the heat phenomena at the edge of the weld, further optimization of the electrode distance will allow to improve the temperature uniformity.

\end{figure}

Although, the SLS results reported in the literature for traditional resistance welding are higher than the results currently obtained with this new nanocomposite heating element, the optimization of several parameters, including the composition of the nanocomposite, is expected to yield performance improvements. 

\subsection{FTIR results}

When comparing the FTIR spectra of PEI nanocomposite before and after the welding process, no signs of degradation could be noted. 
The characteristic peeks for \ch{CH3}, \ch{CH} and \ch{C=O} were left unchanged by the welding process. 

\subsection{Discussion}

Although they neglected many phenomena such as tunnelling effect and the scale of the components relative to molecular sizes, the continuum mechanic simulations described in the exploratory phase gave a sufficient insight on the heating mechanisms involved. 
Molecular dynamic models could provide greater details about the heat transfer and heat generation but the local variations in the material properties would not affect the global trend seen in the continuum mechanic models \cite{Rafiee2013}. 
Considering all the results from the simulations, the small-scale experiments and the FTIR analysis, no damage is occurring in the nanocomposite under the present operating conditions. 
In addition, the ability to control the temperature through manipulation of the input voltage gives a reliable control mechanism for the welding process. 
Combining these results leads to the conclusion that a nanocomposite heating element is a viable alternative to stainless steel meshes for resistance welding of high performance thermoplastic composites. 

With this nanocomposite heating element, it was possible to scale the mechanism and successfully weld coupons. 
More work will be required to define a window of operations for the resistance welding process with this new heating element, but current results are sufficient to serve as proof of concept.

\section{Timescale analysis}

Although PEEK has poor thermal conductivity, uniform temperature fields with temperature variations not exceeding \SI{1e-5}{\celsius} are observed in the models. 
A comparative numerical analysis of the timescales for thermal diffusion, can explain this behaviour. 
This timescale is evaluated using the time constant for thermal diffusion ($t_D$) : 

\begin{equation}
	t_D = \frac{L^2}{\alpha}
	\label{equa:time_constant}
\end{equation}

	\label{fig:square_packing}
\end{figure}

Assuming a uniform square packing of evenly distributed particles (Fig. \ref{fig:square_packing}) of known diameter ($d$) and variable volume fractions ($v_f$), it is possible to evaluate the average half distance ($L$) between particles :

\begin{equation}
	L = \sqrt{\frac{\pi \ d^2}{16 \ v_f}}
	\label{equa:L_average}
\end{equation}

The thermal diffusivity ($\alpha$) is defined as a function of thermal conductivity ($k$), density ($\rho$) and specific heat ($C_p$) : 

\begin{equation}
	\alpha = \frac{k}{\rho \ C_p}
	\label{equa:thermal_diffusivity}

\end{tabular}%}
\caption{Timescale for heat conduction}
\label{tab:results_timescale}
\end{table}

Since the thermal conductivity of MWCNTs is very high compared to the polymer, only the properties of the matrix were considered in this timescale analysis. 
Table \ref{tab:results_timescale} presents the time constants calculated for thermal diffusion within the polymer matrix. 
The time constants varied from $3 \times 10^{-8}$ to \SI{2e-9}{\second} for $v_f$ varying from 1\% to 16\%. 
Considering that the simulations looked at Joule heating on a scale closer to the second, the short timescales for thermal diffusion explain the constant temperature fields.
