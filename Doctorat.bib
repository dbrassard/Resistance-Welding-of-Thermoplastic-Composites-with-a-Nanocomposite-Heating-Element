The experimental results indicate that, when compared to conventional oven based techniques, the use of an “out-of-oven” A-CNT integrated heater leads to orders of magnitude reductions in the energy required to process polymeric layered structures such as composites. Integration of this technology into structural systems enables the in situ curing of large-scale polymeric systems at high efficiencies, while adding sensing and control capabilities.},

abstract = {Novel poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK)/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/glass fiber laminates incorporating polysulfone as a compatibilizing agent were fabricated by melt-blending and hot-press processing. Their morphology, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties were investigated and compared with the behavior of similar non-compatibilized composites. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated better SWCNT dispersion for samples with polysulfone. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of PEEK/glass fiber by the incorporation of SWCNTs wrapped in the compatibilizer, ascribed to a significant thermal conductivity enhancement. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the crystallization temperature and crystallinity of the polymer with the addition of both wrapped and non-wrapped SWCNTs. The laminates exhibit anisotropic electrical behavior; their conductivity out-of-plane is lower than that in-plane. Dynamic mechanical studies revealed an increase in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature in the presence of polysulfone. Mechanical tests demonstrated significant enhancements in stiffness, strength and toughness by the incorporation of wrapped nanofillers, whilst the mechanical properties of non-compatibilized composites only improved marginally. Samples with laser-grown SWCNTs exhibit enhanced overall performance. This investigation confirms that SWCNT-reinforced PEEK/glass fiber compatibilized composites possess excellent potential to be used as multifunctional engineering materials in industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The viscosity-shear rate functions for polysulfone (PSF) condensates ranging from 0.4RV to 0.95RV were determined using capillary rheometry, The most probable distribution of molecular weights of these resins allowed facile comparison with the polydisperse Bueche theory for viscosity, The agreement in shape of the viscosity function with theory was good but the data were displaced by a factor of 3 to 4 to higher reduced shear rate, a fairly common occurrence for melts. The high absolute value of PSF viscosity was explained with existing empirical correlations as a combination of low critical molecular weight and strong intermolecular interactions. The temperature dependence of viscosity was found to be close to that for polystyrene in the temperature range, Tg + 90 to Tg + 190°C. The die swell, end corrections, and melt fracture characteristics were also determined. The latter was found to occur at a constant wall shear stress of about 6 × 10{\^{}}6 dynes/cm2 while the die swell and end corrections were found to be small.},

abstract = {The electrical and thermal conductivity of systems based on epoxy resin (ER) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) filled with metal powders have been studied. Copper and nickel powders having different particle shapes were used as fillers. The composite preparation conditions allow the formation of a random distribution of metallic particles in the polymer matrix volume for the systems ER-Cu, ER-Ni, PVC-Cu and to create ordered shell structure in the PVC-Ni system. A model is proposed to describe the shell structure electric conductivity. The percolation theory equation ?????(??-??c)t with t = 2.4-3.2 (exceeding the universal t = 1.7 value) holds true for the systems with dispersed filler random distribution, but not for the PVC-Ni system. The percolation threshold ??c depends on both particle shape and type of spatial distribution (random or ordered). In contrast to the electrical conductivity, the concentration dependence of thermal conductivity shows no jump in the percolation threshold region. For the description of the concentration dependence of the electrical and thermal conductivity, the key parameter is the packing factor F. F takes into account the influence of conductive phase topology and particle shape on the electrical and thermal conductivity. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Uniform and highly conductive CNT/PE nanocomposite layer was formed without undermining the original alignment of the CNTs. CNT patterns have also been precisely fabricated on PE samples. The PE/CNT/PE bonds showed high interfacial strengths, which were affected by the duration of microwave radiation.

Coating is a new compounding method proposed in this research, where xGnP and PP powder are premixed in isopropyl alcohol using sonication to disperse the xGnP by coating individual PP powder particles. It is found that the coating method is more effective than the polymer solution method widely used, in terms of lowering the percolation threshold of thermoplastic nanocomposites, and enhancing the probability that the large platelet morphology of xGnP can be preserved in the final composite. The research reported here provides an understanding on how the compounding method used during the fabrication of nanocomposites is important to achieving the optimal flexural properties, electrical conductivity and percolation threshold.

However, their most promising appli- cations require the isolation of individualized, purified nanotubes, often with specific optoelectronic characteristics. A wide range of dispersion and separation techniques have been developed, but the use of sonication or ultracentrifugation imposes severe limits on scalability and may introduce damage. Here, we demonstrate a new, intrinsically scalable method for SWNT dispersion and separation, using reductive treatment in sodium metal-ammonia solutions, optionally followed by selective dissolution in a polar aprotic organic solvent. In situ small-angle neutron scattering demonstrates the presence of dissolved, unbundled SWNTs in solution, at concentrations reaching at least 2 mg/mL; the ability to isolate individual nanotubes is confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Spectroscopy data suggest that the soluble fraction contains predominately large metallic nanotubes; a potential new mechanism for nanotube separation is proposed. In addition, the G/D ratios observed during the dissolution sequence, as a function of metal: carbon ratio, demonstrate a new purification method for removing carbonaceous impurities from pristine SWNTs, which avoids traditional, damaging, competitive oxidation reactions.},

The thickness of the interlayer of the expanded graphite was shown to be close to the nanometer scale. The reported filler content was much lower than that required for conventional PMMA/carbon black (8 wt.{\%} carbon) and PMMA/graphite (3.5 wt.{\%} graphite) composites. The improvements in both electrical conductivity and structural integrity were attributed to the difference in filler geometry (aspect ratio and surface area) and the formation of conductive networks in the composites. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Further, the ability of the TEPs-modified joints to support temperature controlled debonding was evaluated. It was showed that the control of the debonding process by temperature is possible. The temperature needed for debonding is a function of TEPs content and can be lowered by increasing the TEPs content.},

abstract = {The dielectric relaxation due to interfacial charges in metal particle-filled composites occurs in the optical (high frequency) regime. However, many applications would benefit from a shift of the relaxation to a much lower frequency regime (e.g. radio or microwave range). This could be achieved by using a filler with reduced conductivity, but there is no continuum of conductivity in naturally occurring materials to allow engineers to readily achieve this aim or to have complete design freedom. Recently, it was demonstrated, experimentally and theoretically, how insulating particles with nano-scale metal coatings enable this relaxation to be shifted to a lower frequency regime. The current work investigates the microstructure of the metal coating, highlighting a semi-continuous coating structure. Therefore, the relevance of a two-dimensional (2D) percolation -based model to describe the effective dielectric properties of the coating is explored. It is demonstrated that a model in which the metal coating is assumed to be near the 2D percolation threshold can provide a reasonable fit to the experimental data. An improved fit is achieved when a distribution of metal area coverage is permitted.},

A non-isothermal degradation kinetic model has been used to find out the upper boundary of the heating time.

abstract = {The release assessment of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was performed on two types of polymer-CNT nanocomposites: polypropylene (PP) and polyamide 6 (PA6) containing 3 wt{\%} CNT. Nanocomposite films were prepared and then exposed to ethanol as a fatty-food simulant at 40 °C, and the amount of CNT release into ethanol was determined by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The CNTs released into ethanol were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and verified by Raman spectroscopy. UV-Vis analysis showed a very small amount of CNT release from the nanocomposite films into ethanol over 60 d: maximum CNT concentrations in ethanol were 1.3 mg/L for the PP-CNT film and 1.2 mg/L for the PA6-CNT film. GFAAS results indicated that the amount of CNTs released into ethanol after 12 d was over 20-fold higher than the results obtained by UV-Vis. Overestimation of CNT release by GFAAS suggested aggregation and poor dispersion of CNTs in the solvent. This assumption was verified by TEM images exhibiting the embedded CNTs in the polymer flakes, which could be poorly dispersed in the solvent. In general, CNT release from the nanocomposite films was considered a surface phenomenon, as indicated by detachment of CNT-containing polymer flakes from the film surface.},

Highly aligned nanocomposite films were produced by extruding the polymer melt through a rectangular die and drawing the film prior to cooling. Randomly oriented nanocomposites were produced by achieving dispersion first with the twin-screw extruder followed by pressing a film using a hydraulic press. The tensile behaviour of the aligned and random nanocomposite films with 5 wt.{\%} loading of nanotubes were characterized. Addition of nanotubes increased the tensile modulus, yield strength and ultimate strengths of the polymer films, and the improvement in elastic modulus with the aligned nanotube composite is five times greater than the improvement for the randomly oriented composite.},

Experimental results show that the GF/PEI prepreg could effectively prevent current leakage and enlarge the welding area. Welding parameters, such as input power level, welding time and pressure, were optimized according to the results of mechanical and microstructure characterization. Mechanical performance of composite specimens joined using metal mesh, in terms of lap shear strength and Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, was equivalent to that of compression moulded benchmarks. Fracture surfaces of welded specimens showed mostly cohesive failure or intralaminar failure, indicating that good bonding between the PEI matrix and metal mesh was achieved.},

abstract = {Conductive Polymer Composite (CPC) can be considered one of the best material candidates for the bipolar plates in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells due to its balance between electrical and mechanical properties, low cost and ease of manufacturing. The development of the models has been shown to be important for predicting the electrical properties of the CPCs. The main challenge is to produce a constant electric supply in the fuel cell systems which influence the overall fuel cell performance. Generally, the classical percolation theory describes that the electrical conductivity of the polymer composite is achieved when the volume fraction of the conductive filler is above the specific value, known as percolation threshold phenomena. Current research trends using the General Effective Media (GEM) model show it is the best model to predict the electrical properties of the composite. The main advantage of using the GEM is the model can predict the electrical conductivity for multiple filler systems at high filler loadings. Numerous factors including volume fraction, shape and size, aspect ratio, critical value, and orientation are significant in developing a robust model. Controlling the filler orientations in the CPCs are important as they are able to improve the mechanical performance while enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composite. Orientation can be induced by a few methods such as shear stress, altering die and fillers aspect ratio based on the needs. By controlling the fillers direction, one is able to control both the mechanical and electrical conductivity of the CPCs. However, recent publications seem to suggest that the Fibre Contact Model (FCM) is the latest model that considers the orientation factor in predicting conductivity. A good agreement between experimental results and modelling prediction can be observed using carbon-fibre reinforced polypropylene below and above the percolation threshold. Parallel orientations of the fibres to the extrusion die direction provided better electrical conductivity compared to randomly oriented fillers. This manuscript attempts to discuss other potential models used in predicting the electrical conductivity of the CPCs.},

In particular, the latter allows growing carbon nanotubes on diverse substrate materials at low temperatures.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation characterising the fatigue failure mechanisms of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites skin/stringer joints is presented. Unidirectional (UD) and quasi-isotropic adherends were welded using stainless steel meshes as heating elements. The specimen geometry consisted of a flange laminate, representing a stringer, welded onto a skin laminate. In order to avoid current leakage to the electrically conductive adherends, a ceramic-coated heating element (TiO2 HE) was used for welding the UD specimens and some of the quasi-isotropic specimens. The fatigue performance of the welded joints was investigated under three-point bending. An indefinite fatigue life was obtained at 40{\%} and 35{\%} of the static damage initiation load for the UD and quasi-isotropic specimens, respectively. The failure mechanisms were documented based on observation of the fatigue cracks initiation and growth. UD specimens failed at the weld interface while quasi-isotropic specimens showed delaminations both in the flange or skin laminates and at the weld interface. The TiO2 HE did not show any fatigue mechanical performance reduction. However, debonding at the weld interface was shown to occur between the metal mesh wires and the TiO2 coating instead of between the laminates and the weld. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One method of incorporating intrinsic ESC mitigation while maintaining low color, flexibility, and optical clarity is through the utilization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). However, SWNTs are difficult to uniformly disperse in the polymer matrix. The approach reported herein employed amide acid polymers endcapped with alkoxysilane groups that could condense with oxygen containing functionalities that were present on the ends of SWNTs as a result of the oxidative purification treatment. These SWNTs were combined with the endcapped amide acid polymers in solution and subsequently cast as unoriented thin films. Two examples possessed electrical conductivity (measured as surface resistance and surface resistivity) sufficient for ESC mitigation at loading levels of ≤0.08wt{\%} SWNT as well as good retention of thermo-optical properties. The percolation threshold was determined to lie between 0.03 and 0.04wt{\%} SWNT loading. Electrical conductivity of the film remained unaffected even after harsh mechanical manipulation.},

abstract = {Insulating materials filled with conducting particles permit tailoring of electrical, electromagnetic and thermal properties of the resulting composite. When the filler particles are small and metallic, a dielectric relaxation due to interfacial polarization is commonly observed at optical or smaller wavelengths. Here, experimental results are presented in which the dielectric relaxation is shifted to microwave frequencies as a result of using metal-coated dielectric particles with a nano-scale coating thickness. The results are analysed in the context of effective medium theory adapted for multi-layer particles. Such a large shift in relaxation frequency, compared with that for a similar composite with solid metal filler particles, is shown to be a function of both the coating geometry and a thin-film-related reduction in the conductivity of the metal. The observed broadening of the relaxation peak is attributed to non-uniformity of the coating thickness and a consequent distribution of coating conductivity.},

The s-CNT/PE composite exhibits superior electrical conductivity up to 2 orders of magnitude over that of p-CNT/PE and r-CNT/PE composites, at the same CNT loading. Only 5 wt{\%} CNT addition in the s-CNT/PE composite realizes an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) as high as 46.4 dB, which is 20{\%} and 46{\%} higher than that for p-CNT/PE and r-CNT/PE composites, respectively. The selectively distributed CNTs at the interfaces between PE polyhedrons would certainly increase the effective CNT concentrations that form conducting pathways and thus increase the electrical conductivity and EMI SE in the s-CNT/PE composites. Such special structure also provides numerous interfaces that absorb the electromagnetic waves, resulting in an absorption-dominated shielding mechanism. Our work suggests that designing conductive networks in polymer composites is a promising approach to develop high-performance EMI shielding materials.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes represent a relatively recently discovered allotrope of carbon that exhibits unique properties. While commercial interest in the material is leading to the development of mass production and handling facilities, little is known of the risk associated with exposure. In a two-part study, preliminary investigations have been carried out into the potential exposure routes and toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotube material (SWCNT)--a specific form of the allotrope. The material is characterized by bundles of fibrous carbon molecules that may be a few nanometers in diameter, but micrometers in length. The two production processes investigated use-transition metal catalysts, leading to the inclusion of nanometer-scale metallic particles within unrefined SWCNT material. A laboratory-based study was undertaken to evaluate the physical nature of the aerosol formed from SWCNT during mechanical agitation. This was complemented by a field study in which airborne and dermal exposure to SWCNT was investigated while handling unrefined material. Although laboratory studies indicated that with sufficient agitation, unrefined SWCNT material can release fine particles into the air, concentrations generated while handling material in the field were very low. Estimates of the airborne concentration of nanotube material generated during handling suggest that concentrations were lower than 53 microg/m(3) in all cases. Glove deposits of SWCNT during handling were estimated at between 0.2 mg and 6 mg per hand.},

The influence of the process parameters electromagnetic frequency, generator power, distance between induction coil and laminate, coil geometry and laminate lay-up on the heating rate and the heat distribution have been investigated in stationary experiments. It was found that all investigated parameters have significant influence on the heating behaviour and that a quadratic dependence is dominating. Heat is only generated when closed fibre loops exist, through which current can flow. The quality of the fibre junctions in a laminate, especially the contact length, was found to be of major importance. Thus, for example laminates with unidirectional fibre reinforcement, which do not contain fibre junctions, cannot be heated. Experimental evidence has shown that induction heating of carbon-fibre-reinforced thermoplastics is based on Joule losses.},

abstract = {Since their first observation nearly a decade ago by Iijima (Iijima S. Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon Nature. 1991; 354:56–8), carbon nanotubes have been the focus of considerable research. Numerous investigators have since reported remarkable physical and mechanical properties for this new form of carbon. From unique electronic properties and a thermal conductivity higher than diamond to mechanical properties where the stiffness, strength and resilience exceeds any current material, carbon nanotubes offer tremendous opportunities for the development of fundamentally new material systems. In particular, the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, combined with their low density, offer scope for the development of nanotube-reinforced composite materials. The potential for nanocomposites reinforced with carbon tubes having extraordinary specific stiffness and strength represent tremendous opportunity for application in the 21st century. This paper provides a concise review of recent advances in carbon nanotubes and their composites. We examine the research work reported in the literature on the structure and processing of carbon nanotubes, as well as characterization and property modeling of carbon nanotubes and their composites.},

abstract = {Current leakage is a concern with resistance welding of carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. This phenomenon is particularly important when unidirectional adherends, with the carbon fibres parallel to the electrical current direction, are welded. In this investigation, a new electrically-insulated heating element consisting of a ceramic-coated (TiO2) stainless steel mesh was developed to prevent current leakage. Special specimen geometry, called a skin/stringer configuration, was welded with this newly developed heating element to represent typical reinforced aerospace structures. The adherends were made of APC-2/AS4 (carbon fibre/PEEK) composites. Unidirectional specimens, which represent the most critical case, were first welded using the new heating element. The insulated heating element successfully prevented current leakage and showed great improvement in temperature homogeneity over the weld area. The impact of the new heating element on the mechanical performance of the welds was then assessed by welding quasi-isotropic specimens. The mechanical performances of quasi-isotropic specimens welded using the new insulated heating elements and conventional (non-insulated) ones were compared under short beam and three-point bending tests. No mechanical performance drawback was observed with the new heating element; however, the failure mode of the welded quasi-isotropic specimens was changed from a delamination in the skin laminate failure to a weld interface debonding failure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes (P-MWCNTs) were functionalized with carboxylic groups (MWCNT-COOH) through oxidation reactions and then reduced to produce hydroxyl groups (MWCNT-OH). Pristine and functionalized MWCNTs were used to produce poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanocomposites with 0.5 wt{\%} of MWCNTs. MWCNT functionalization was verified by visual stability in water, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and zeta potential measurements. Pristine and functionalized MWCNTs acted as the nucleating agent in a PHBV matrix, as verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). However, the dispersion of filler into the matrix, thermal stability, and direct current (DC) conductivity were affected by MWCNT functionalization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that filler dispersion into the PHBV matrix was improved with MWCNT functionalization. The surface roughness was reduced with the addition and functionalization of MWCNT. The thermal stability of PHBV/MWCNT-COOH, PHBV/P-MWCNT, and PHBV/MWCNT-OH nanocomposites were 20, 30, and 30 °C higher than neat PHBV, respectively, as verified by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). Addition of pristine and functionalized MWCNTs provided electrical conductivity in nanocomposite, which was higher for PHBV/P-MWCNTs (1.2 × 10-5 S cm-1).},

abstract = {We proposed a strategy to enhance the conductivity of polycarbonate by using three-phase hybrid metallic/non-metallic fillers. Ethylene diamine (EDA) functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-EDA) are first decorated with silver nanoparticles. These Ag/ MWCNT-EDA fillers are then coated with a conductive layer of ethylene glycol treated PEDOT: PSS (poly [3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene]: poly [styrenesulfonate]) (EP). In such an approach, the MWCNT backbone is covered by a highly conductive coating made of Ag nanoparticles surrounded by EP. To understand how Ag and EP form a highly conductive coating, the effect of different wt{\%} of Ag nanoparticles on EP was studied. Ag nanoparticles around the size of 128 ?? 28 nmeffectively lowered the volume resistivity of bulk EP, resulting in a highly conducting Ag/EP blend. We found that in the final Ag/MWCNT-EDA/EP assembly, the EP coating enhances the electrical conductivity in two ways: (1) it is an efficient dispersing agent that helps in achieving a uniform dispersion of the Ag/MWCNT-EDA and (2) it acts as a conductive bridge between particles (Ag and MWCNT-EDA), reducing the particle to particle resistivity. When inserted into polycarbonate, this three-phase blend successfully reduced the volume resistivity of the polymer by two orders of magnitude compared with previous approaches.},

Lap-shear and double-cantilever-beam specimens were resistance welded by using fabric and unidirectional heating elements. The statistical distribution of the resistance of the heating elements was characterised, and the effects of the temperature on the heating element resistance were evaluated. The influence of the mechanical contact pressure on the contact resistance was also investigated. One of the main process parameters in resistance welding, i.e. the power density, was studied in detail. Heating uniformity in the heating elements was assessed through thermal imaging, allowing for a comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements. Temperature histories were measured and compared to those simulated by a three-dimensional transient heat transfer finite-element model. Factors limiting the size of the welded joint, i.e. temperature non-uniformity within the welding area and current leaking to the laminate, were investigated. Proper electrical insulation using a glass-fibre/PEI interlayer between the heating element and the laminate when joining carbon-fibre/PEI laminates effectively eliminated current leaking and enabled large-scale resistance welding.},

abstract = {The automated two placement process developed in the aircraft industry is an emerging technique for manufacturing continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic parts. Our objective is to understand the physical mechanisms taking place in the APC-2 (carbon/PEEK) welding phenomenon in order to model and improve the process. The originality of the study was to develop a process thermal model at a macroscopic scale and simultaneously to deeply study phenomenon at a macromolecular scale. The 2D thermal model enables to simulate the ply consolidation whatever the process parameters. It takes into account heat transfers via conduction and convection plus melting and crystallisation phenomena whose kinetics were determined experimentally. Concerning macromolecular chains dynamics, reptation time relative to chain diffusion at the interface was approached by rheological tests. It has been shown that PEEK thermal degradation mechanism is mainly crosslinking; the crosslinking kinetics has been followed by ageing rheological tests. The coupling of these studies enables to predict the consolidation efficiency and to determine a good welding zone in the Time-Temperature process window. These simulations are compared to mechanical tests relative to the welded interface. Hence, we defined limits imposed by antagonist physical phenomena for this in-situ consolidation and understood how to ameliorate the process for a better welding.},

abstract = {Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) of films and coatings involve the chemical reactions of gaseous reactants on or near the vicinity of a heated substrate surface. This atomistic deposition method can provide highly pure materials with structural control at atomic or nanometer scale level. Moreover, it can produce single layer, multilayer, composite, nanostructured, and functionally graded coating materials with well controlled dimension and unique structure at low processing temperatures. Furthermore, the unique feature of CVD over other deposition techniques such as the non-line-of-sight-deposition capability has allowed the coating of complex shape engineering components and the fabrication of nano-devices, carbon-carbon (C-C) composites, ceramic matrix composite (CMCs), free standing shape components. The versatility of CVD had led to rapid growth and it has become one of the main processing methods for the deposition of thin films and coatings for a wide range of applications, including semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge, Si 1-xGe x, III-V, II-VI) for microelectronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion devices; dielectrics (e.g. SiO 2, AlN, Si 3N 4) for microelectronics; refractory ceramic materials (e.g. SiC, TiN, TiB 2, Al 2O 3, BN, MoSi 2, ZrO 2) used for hard coatings, protection against corrosion, oxidation or as diffusion barriers; metallic films (e.g. W, Mo, Al, Au, Cu, Pt) for microelectronics and for protective coatings; fibre production (e.g. B and SiC monofilament fibres) and fibre coating. This contribution aims to provide a brief overview of CVD of films and coatings. The fundamental aspects of CVD including process principle, deposition mechanism, reaction chemistry, thermodynamics, kinetics and transport phenomena will be presented. In addition, the practical aspects of CVD such as the CVD system and apparatus used, CVD process parameters, process control techniques, range of films synthesized, characterisation and co-relationships of structures and properties will be presented. The advantages and limitations of CVD will be discussed, and its applications will be briefly reviewed. The article will also review the development of CVD technologies based on different heating methods, and the type of precursor used which has led to different variants of CVD methods including thermally activated CVD, plasma enhanced CVD, photo-assisted CVD, atomic layer epitaxy process, metalorganic assisted CVD. There are also variants such as fluidised-bed CVD developed for coating powders; electrochemical vapour deposition for depositing dense films onto porous substrates; chemical vapour infiltration for the fabrication of C-C composites and CMCs through the deposition and densification of ceramic layers onto porous fibre preforms. The emerging cost-effective CVD-based techniques such as electrostatic-aerosol assisted CVD and flame assisted CVD will be highlighted. The scientific and technological significance of these different variants of CVD will be discussed and compared with other vapour processing techniques such as Physical Vapour Deposition. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy and N2-adsorption analysis were carried out to characterize the composite catalysts. In using the sol-gel method, the MWCNTs were coated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, and by the hydrothermal method, rutile TiO2 nanorods were uniformly deposited on the MWCNTs. The photocatalytic activities of the composite catalysts were evaluated by the reduction of CO2 with H2O. The results indicate that the addition of an appropriate amount of MWCNTs as supports for TiO2 could remarkably improve the efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction. The composite catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method lead to the main formation of C2H5OH, while HCOOH is found to be the major product on the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The predicted strengths are extensively compared with the experimental and atomistic simulation results for carbon nanotubes available in the literature. All these approaches unequivocally suggest that the megacable strength will be reduced by a factor at least of ∼70{\%} with respect to the theoretical nanotube strength, today (erroneously) assumed in the cable design. The reason is the unavoidable presence of defects in so huge a cable. Preliminary in-silicon tensile experiments confirm the same finding. The deduced strength reduction is sufficient to place in doubt the effective realization of the space elevator, that if built as designed today will certainly break (in the author's opinion). The mechanics of the cable is also revised and possible damage sources discussed.},

A three-dimensional transient finite element model (FEM) featuring heat transfer, consolidation and thermal degradation was used for simulating the process. A hybrid interlayer made of a glass fibre (GF) fabric essentially impregnated with PEI on one side and with epoxy resin on the other side was produced to provide mechanical interlocking between the thermoplastic (TP) and the thermosetting (TS) systems. The 'optimal' resistance welding time based on the maximum lap shear strength (LSS) was determined for three power levels and correlated to the time required to achieve bonding predicted by the FEM. Consolidation quality and failure mechanisms were discussed in relation with processing parameters. Experimental and simulated processing windows were constructed and correlated to each other. However, thermal degradation as predicted by the model did not correlate to a reduction in performance of the joint. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The optimum resistance welding time based on a criterion of maximum lap shear strength was determined. The time required to achieve intimate contact predicted by a three-dimensional transient finite-element model featuring heat transfer and consolidation correlated well with the optimal welding time. The influence of the welding pressure on lap shear strength was investigated, and the consolidation quality obtained in the welded joint was related to the processing conditions. The extent of flow occurring during welding, or the reduction of thickness of the welded joints, was shown to be related to lap shear strength. Four failure mechanisms, leading to different values of lap shear strength, were identi{\textregistered}ed including interfacial failure, cohesive failure of the heating element, tearing of the heating element and tearing of the laminate. Experimental and numerical processing windows were constructed and correlated well to each other. A comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements, in terms of lap shear strength and the interlaminar fracture toughness, GIc, was performed. It was demonstrated that large-scale lap-shear coupons and double cantilever beam specimens can be resistance welded providing that current leaking to the laminate is avoided.},

This paper aims to summarize the principles of induction heating with respect to polymer composites processing taking a look first at material and equipment based process influences. State of the art applications and research activities are then reviewed, from thermoplastic composite welding, thermoset curing, selective material heating and fast mould heating technologies.

abstract = {Characterization and purification studies have been performed on the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), prepared by the large-scale (i.e., at production rates of similar to 100 g h(-1)) induction thermal plasma process. The main impurities present in the as-produced soot materials are first identified by various material analyses and turn out to be amorphous carbon, graphitic carbon particles, and metal/metal-oxide catalysts, but without significant content of fullerenes. In particular, the amounts of graphitic particles present were high in comparison with those of other plasma arc or laser-grown SWNTs, and it is believed that these graphitic particles mainly originate from the remains of the feedstock materials. On the basis of this observation, different purification protocols have been explored by combining the two-step processes of thermal oxidation in air and liquid oxidation in a variety of acids. At each step of the purification, the changes in the SWNT samples are monitored by various analytical techniques, and the results reveal that the air oxidation at 350 degrees C for 1h, followed by refluxing in 7 M HNO3 for 6 h, provides for the best efficiency in conducting the purification of the thermal plasma-grown SWNT. The material properties of the purified samples, such as the electrical resistivity and the specific surface area (SSA), have also been analyzed by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the four-probe methods, the measured values being similar to 500 m(2) g(-1) and similar to 2 x 10(-3) Omega cm, respectively},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit excellent mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties as well as nanometer scale diameter and high aspect ratio, which make them an ideal reinforcing agent for high strength polymer composites. However, since CNTs usually form stabilized bundles due to Van der Waals interactions, are extremely difficult to disperse and align in a polymer matrix. The biggest issues in the preparation of CNT-reinforced composites reside in efficient dispersion of CNTs into a polymer matrix, the assessment of the dispersion, and the alignment and control of the CNTs in the matrix. There are several methods for the dispersion of nanotubes in the polymer matrix such as solution mixing, melt mixing, electrospinning, in-situ polymerization and chemical functionalization of the carbon nanotubes, etc. These methods and preparation of high performance CNT-polymer composites are described in this review. A critical comparison of various CNT functionalization methods is given. In particular, CNT functionalization using click chemistry and the preparation of CNT composites employing hyperbranched polymers are stressed as potential techniques to achieve good CNT dispersion. In addition, discussions on mechanical, thermal, electrical, electrochemical and optical properties and applications of polymer/CNT composites are included.},

abstract = {This research explored the potential of using exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets, GNP, as the conductive filler to construct highly conductive polymeric nanocomposites to substitute for conventional metallic and graphite bipolar plates in the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was selected as the polymer matrix because of its high thermal and chemical tolerance. Solid state ball milling (SSBM) followed by compression molding was then applied to fabricate PPS/GNP nanocomposites. Results showed that PPS/GNP nanocomposites made by this method exhibit excellent mechanical and gas barrier properties but unsatisfied electrical conductivity. However, it was found that the electrical conductivity of these nanocomposites could be substantially enhanced if we combine GNP with second minor conductive filler for a positive synergistic effect and also optimize the processing time of SSBM. Meanwhile, PPS impregnated GNP papers were embedded into these PPS/GNP nanocomposites in order to further improve various properties of the resulting bipolar plates. It is believed that the bipolar plates made from PPS/GNP nanocomposites will allow lighter weight of PEM fuel cells with enhanced performance which is particularly suited for automotive applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Measurements on randomly oriented MWCNTs and SWCNTs were made by depositing a thin film of CNTs within a calorimetric cell. Anisotropic measurements were made on MWCNTs grown inside the highly ordered, densely packed nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide. The specific heat of randomly oriented MWCNTs and SWCNTs showed similar behavior to the specific heat of bulk graphite powder. However, the specific heat of aligned MWCNTs is smaller and has weaker temperature dependence than that of the bulk above room temperature. The effective thermal conductivity of randomly oriented MWCNTs and SWCNTs is similar to that of powder graphite, exhibiting a maximum value near 364 K indicating the onset of phonon-phonon scattering.

abstract = {The development of polymer based conductive composites is required in aeronautical applications where electrostatic charges and heat need to be evacuated. Optimization of conductive filler content is necessary to maintain low density and high mechanical properties provided by the polymer matrix. We introduced silver nanoparticles in Polyetheretherketone. Electrical conductivity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity have been determined as a function of filler content and temperature. In particular, we studied the influence of silver nanoparticles aspect ratio on these thermal properties. We compared nanospheres with nanowires. A low electrical percolation threshold (0.55 vol{\%}) is obtained for silver nanowires composites compared to spherical particles (10.8 vol{\%}). Thermal conductivity increases with silver content and the influence of filler aspect ratio is interesting: thanks to nanowires, the thermal conductivity enhancement is reached for lower silver content. Experimental data are well fitted with Nan model. Specific heat capacity decreases with the introduction of silver nanoparticles, following the mixture rule independently of aspect ratio. Composites thermal diffusivity also increases with increasing silver content and influence of filler aspect ratio can be brought to light. Temperature dependence of these thermal properties indicate a dominant heat transport mechanism typical of disordered materials},

abstract = {A simple approach to decorate carbon nanotube (CNT) with silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) was developed to enhance the electrical conductivity of CNT. CNTs were functionalized using ball milling in the presence of ammonium bicarbonate, followed by reduction of silver ions in N, N-dimethylformamide, producing silver decorated CNTs (Ag@CNTs). The Ag@CNTs were employed as conducting filler in epoxy resin to fabricate electrically conducting polymer composites. The electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of the composites were measured and compared with those containing pristine and functionalized CNTs. It was found that when pH was about six, highly dispersed Ag-NPs can be decorated on functionalized CNTs. The electrical conductivity of composites containing 0.10 wt{\%} of Ag@CNTs was more than four orders of magnitude higher than those containing same content of pristine and functionalized CNTs, confirming the advantage of the Ag@CNTs as effective conducting filler. The ameliorating effect of improved electrical conductivity was not at the expense of thermal or mechanical properties. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The interfacial characteristics directly influence the efficiency of nanotube reinforcements in improving mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the polymer nanocomposite. In this review, various techniques of interaction measurements, including experimental and modelling studies, are described. From the experimental approaches, wetting, spectroscopy and probe microscopy techniques are discussed in detail. Molecular dynamics, coarse grain simulation and density functional theory are also explained as the main modelling approaches in interaction measurement studies. Different methods of interaction improvement, mainly categorized under covalent and noncovalent interactions, are described afterwards. Modelling predictions of nanocomposite properties, such as Young's modulus, are compared with the experimental results in the literature and the challenges are discussed. Finally, it is concluded that an optimum carbon nanotube-polymer interaction is a key factor towards reaching the full potential of carbon nanotubes in nanocomposites. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Then the Ag-CNTs were used as fillers to prepare the nanocomposites with two polymers: polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) by means of two different methods: i.e. melt compounding and solution mixing, respectively. The results showed that the Ag-CNTs could effectively improve the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of PP and PS as compared to pristine CNTs. It was found that the solution mixing was better than the melt mixing in terms of dispersion of CNTs and electrical conductivity.

Silver nanoparticles were introduced in Polyetheretherketone matrix and their influence on thermal properties was studied. Thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of composites were determined by Modulated-Temperature Differential Scanning Calorimetry and analysed as a function of particles volume content and temperature. The specific heat capacity of the composites decreases with increasing silver particles content below the electrical percolation threshold. Above the electrical percolation threshold the specific heat capacity decreases more slowly and converge toward the specific heat capacity of compressed silver nanoparticles. The evolution of the thermal conductivity with filler content exhibits a non-linear profile. Experimental data are coherent with the Maxwell model suggesting continuity of the polymer matrix and a contribution of the silver particles to the effective thermal conductivity greater than volume effect. The temperature dependence of the composites thermal conductivity is characteristic of amorphous phase, while a transition from vitreous-like to crystalline-like behaviour of the specific heat capacity is observed with the introduction of metallic particles.},

Electron microscopy confirmed the homogeneous dispersion and alignment of nanofibres. An interpretation of the composite performance by short-fibre theory resulted in rather low intrinsic stiffness properties of the vapour-grown CNF. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that an interaction between matrix and the nanoscale filler could occur during processing.

abstract = {As nanocomposite materials enter the marketplace, it is critical to consider the entire life cycle of those products, including end of life and reuse of scrap. While recycling of polymer based materials is widely accepted for manufacturing and consumer scrap, the influence of the nanoscale filler on the recycling process has received little attention and may pose some unique challenges, such as the potential for human exposure to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the recycling process. In this work, the impact of recycling on CNT-filled polypropylene (PP) properties and exposures was studied by repeated injection molding and granulation up to twenty cycles, while simultaneously monitoring exposures. Characterization of chemical structure, melt rheology, mechanical properties, and morphology were performed on recycled materials. Both the neat and filled materials showed a reduction in viscosity with recycling, but the changes were greater for the neat materials. The mechanical properties (such as modulus, strength, toughness) were also affected by recycling. The Young's modulus, yield strain and stress for both neat PP and CNT-filled PP were found to be little affected by recycling. Strain and stress at break for neat PP decreased with recycling, but only slight changes were found for the CNT-filled PP. The CNT-filled PP showed an increase in toughness with recycling due to changes in the crystallization behaviour. This offers potential for addition of CNTs for the purpose of improving recycling resistance. However, recycling should be performed under proper exposure controls because grinding generated high exposures to nanoparticles and CNT-containing respirable fibers.},

Composite interphases were replicated on planar glass substrates to systematically study the influence of CNT functionalization, glass surface chemistry, and aqueous dispersion quality on the mechanical performance under shear loading. CNTs were functionalized using a novel ultrasonicated-ozonolysis (USO) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) process to prepare films on silane-treated glass surfaces. The epoxy-infused films exhibited a 50{\%} improvement as compared to untreated glass/epoxy interfaces. Detailed surface analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows chemical bonds in the interphase, and computational modeling of the valence band spectra provides additional insight into the chemical nature of the bond. The formation of a PEI–CNT rich interphase facilitates a more homogeneous, ductile fracture zone relative to the brittle glass epoxy interface, and increases composite strength by shifting the fracture surface away from the glass surface. Intentional destabilization of the CNT dispersion resulted in re-agglomeration, diminishing any benefit of the PEI, thereby demonstrating the importance of a stable dispersion provided by the USO processing. The results replicate the trends observed previously in more complex composite systems and provide new insight into interfacial engineering of nanostructured composites.},

@article{Sharma2015,
abstract = {An optical rectenna-a device that directly converts free-propagating electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies to direct current-was first proposed over 40 years ago, yet this concept has not been demonstrated experimentally due to fabrication challenges at the nanoscale. Realizing an optical rectenna requires that an antenna be coupled to a diode that operates on the order of 1 PHz (switching speed on the order of 1 fs). Diodes operating at these frequencies are feasible if their capacitance is on the order of a few attofarads, but they remain extremely difficult to fabricate and to reliably couple to a nanoscale antenna. Here we demonstrate an optical rectenna by engineering metal-insulator-metal tunnel diodes, with a junction capacitance of ∼2 aF, at the tip of vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (∼10 nm in diameter), which act as the antenna. Upon irradiation with visible and infrared light, we measure a d.c. open-circuit voltage and a short-circuit current that appear to be due to a rectification process (we account for a very small but quantifiable contribution from thermal effects). In contrast to recent reports of photodetection based on hot electron decay in a plasmonic nanoscale antenna, a coherent optical antenna field appears to be rectified directly in our devices, consistent with rectenna theory. Finally, power rectification is observed under simulated solar illumination, and there is no detectable change in diode performance after numerous current-voltage scans between 5 and 77 °C, indicating a potential for robust operation.},

One of the important processing steps--intimate contact development-is considered in this paper. Interlaminar inti- mate contact development has a strong dependency on the thermoplastic surface geometry. Profilometric measurements of common thermoplastic prepreg tows, such asAS4/PEEKand IM7/PKA, show that surface roughness features appear at several length scales and that the surfaces have fractal asperity structures. In this paper, principles of fractal geometry are used to describe prepreg surfaces. Based on this description, a microscale fluid flow model is developed to relate a degree of intimate contact to the process parameters (pressure, temperature, and time) and the fractal parameters of the surface. The model development and comparisons with experimental data are presented and discussed.},

The percolation threshold values are 1 wt{\%} (S-EG) and 2 wt{\%} (EG) for PPS/S-EG and PPS/EG nanocomposites, respectively. The variation of mechanical strength with the weight fraction of EG and S-EG in the nanocomposites showed somewhat correlation with the threshold filler concentration. The crystallization behavior of PPS matrix in the nanocomposites was investigated using DSC, and the results indicated that the crystallization process was significantly accelerated, leading to an increase in crystallinity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanocomposites were made by melt-compounding two levels of organoclay with polypropylene. The results of unreinforced polypropylene are shown for reference. All welded assemblies were assessed by tensile testing. The results show that 3-6{\%} of organoclay reinforcement causes a significant decrease in weld strength.},

abstract = {In this investigation, a recent model for assessing the electrical conductivity of nanocomposites comprising a single type of conductive nanofiller was expanded to cases with mixtures of nanofillers. The extended model considers electron tunneling as the effective mechanism for insulator-conductor transition. The model was validated with relevant experimental data based on a mono-nanofiller. Using the extended model, the effective electrical conductivity of a nanocomposite comprising both graphite nanoplatelets and carbon nanotubes was investigated. It was observed that the hybridized nanocomposites filled with a mixture of these conductive nanofillers attain, synergistically, enhanced electrical conductivities at lower volume fractions. The lower filler contents assist in preserving the intrinsic properties of the host polymer in support of several applications. It was also observed that the relative aspect ratios of the conductive fillers play significant roles on the electrical conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite. Simulations revealed that, generally, the addition of minimal amounts of a higher aspect ratio auxiliary phase to a lower aspect ratio main phase enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite by orders of magnitude.},

The resulting CP-AgNW/cPI heater was mechanically stable with increases in resistance of {\textless}10{\%} under long-term cyclic bending to a curvature radius of 500 $\mu$m for up to 50,000 cycles. A roughness measurement revealed that the high flexibility originated from the electrodes being fully embedded at the surface of the polymer. The fabricated electrode was rapidly heated from room temperature to steady-state temperature within 40 s, with a peak temperature exceeding 200 °C. AgNW hybridization with CP layers was more efficient at lower NW densities, demonstrated by comparisons between the measured and calculated sheet resistance (Rs) of the electrodes. The addition of CP to the existing AgNW electrodes enhanced the steady-state temperature and current-carrying capacity of the fabricated heaters. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the proposed method of inverted layer-by-layer processing of AgNWs and CP is suitable to achieve a highly reliable and efficient transparent heater.},

SWNTs have been utilized for the ultrasensitive detection of biological species, providing a label-free approach. SWNT-Raman tags have achieved detection sensitivity down to 1 fmol/L. SWNT-based drug delivery systems have shown promising potential based on preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies. Also, the remarkable optical properties of SWNTs have made them promising candidates as contrast agents for imaging in cells and animals. Moreover, due to their excellent mechanical strength, SWNTs have been used to improve the mechanical properties of solid polymeric nanocomposites and porous scaffolds. Sample preparation procedures for the use of SWNTs as fluorescent imaging labels and in biological composites will be discussed.},

To date, controlled dispersion of CNTs in a solution or a composite matrix remains a challenge, due to the strong van der Waals binding energies associated with the CNT aggregates. There is also insufficiently defined correlation between the microstructure and the physical properties of the composite. Here, we offer a review of the dispersion processes of pristine (non-covalently functionalized) CNTs in a solvent or a polymer solution. We summarize and adapt relevant theoretical analysis to guide the dispersion design and selection, from the processes of mixing/sonication, to the application of surfactants for stabilization, to the final testing of composite properties. The same approaches are expected to be also applicable to the fabrication of other composite materials involving homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles.},

Results of Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the electrical conductivity of composites with wavy nanotubes are lower than that of composites with straight nanotubes.

abstract = {High-performance poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) nanocomposites have been prepared via melt- blending by the incorporation of a hydroxylated polymer derivative (HPEEK) covalently grafted onto the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Their morphology, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties have been investigated and compared with the behaviour of composites reinforced with similar non-grafted fillers. Microscopic observations reveal that the grafting of the HPEEK onto the SWCNTs facilitates their dispersion within the matrix. The crystallization and melting temperature of PEEK decrease upon incorporation of the HPEEK-grafted SWCNTs, ascribed to the restrictions on polymer chain mobility imposed by the strong CNT–matrix interactions. The addition of these fillers leads to an exceptional increase in the thermal stability, storage modulus and glass transition temperature of the matrix. Tensile tests show unprecedented improvements in the Young's modulus, strength and toughness of the composites by the polymer grafting, attributed to a very effective load transfer achieved through covalent and hydrogen bonding. Electrical conductivity measurements indicate that the typical percolation behaviour takes place at very low SWCNT contents. In contrast, the thermal conductivity increases almost linearly with the filler loading. This approach is a simple, scalable and efficient method to improve the overall performance of thermoplastic nanocomposites for potential lightweight structural applications.},

abstract = {Structurally segregated poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS)-based nanocomposite films containing multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) of 0.5???10.0??wt{\%} were manufactured by solid-mixing and following melt-compression. The cross-sectional optical and electron microscopic images of the nanocomposite films revealed that MWCNTs form a segregated and percolated conductive network structure in the PPS matrix. DSC and TGA data demonstrated that melt-crystallization temperatures and thermal degradation temperatures of the nanocomposite films are slightly increased with the MWCNT content, which are owing to the nucleating agent and thermal protection effects of MWCNTs, respectively. The electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite films increased significantly from ???10???10 to ???0.11??S/cm with the increment of the MWCNT content from 0.0 to 10.0??wt{\%}, especially at a low percolation threshold of ???0.33??wt{\%}??MWCNT. Accordingly, PPS-based nanocomposite films with 1.0???10.0??wt{\%} MWCNT exhibited high performance in electrical resistive heating behavior under applied voltages of 5???100??V by achieving steady-state maximum temperatures of 30???190????C within a relatively short period of time of ???10??s.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the influence of carbon nanotube (CNT) characteristics on the electrical conductivity of polystyrene nanocomposites produced using a latex-based approach. We processed both industrially-produced multi-wall CNT (MWCNT) powders and MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films made in-house, and demonstrate that while the raw CNTs are individualized and dispersed comparably within the polymer matrix, the electrical conductivity of the final nanocomposites differs significantly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the CNTs. Owing to their longer length after dispersion, the percolation threshold observed using MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films is five times lower than the value for industrially-produced MWCNT powders. Further, owing to the high structural quality of the CNTs from vertically-aligned films, the resulting composite films exhibit electrical conductivity of 10(3) S m(-1) at 2 wt{\%} CNTs. On the contrary, composites made using the industrially-produced CNTs exhibit conductivity of only tens of S m(-1). To our knowledge, the measured electrical conductivity for CNT/PS composites using CNTs from vertically-aligned films is by far the highest value yet reported for CNT/PS nanocomposites at this loading.},

abstract = {Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK)/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites containing up to 17 wt{\%} filler were prepared using a twin screw extruder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the MWNTs were homogeneously dispersed in the PEEK matrix. Linear viscoelastic measurements show that both complex viscosity and moduli increase with increasing MWNT concentration. The storage modulus, G′ exhibits a dramatic seven order increase in magnitude around 1 wt{\%}, leading to a solid-like low-frequency behaviour at higher loadings; the effect can be attributed to network formation at a rheological percolation threshold. Rheotens measurements show that the melt strength also increases significantly on addition of nanotubes, however, the drawability decreases. An analytical Wagner model was used to calculate the apparent elongational viscosity over a wide range of elongational rates, and to reveal significant increases on addition of MWNTs, with a similar threshold behaviour. The electrical response is also dominated by percolation effects, increasing by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 10-11 to 10-1 S/cm, on the addition of only 2 wt{\%} MWNTs. In contrast, the thermal conductivity and tensile elastic modulus of the composites increased linearly with nanotube content, rising by 130{\%} and 50{\%}, at 17 wt{\%} MWNTs, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {New poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) based composites have been fabricated by the incorporation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using melt processing. Their structure, morphology, thermal and mechanical properties have been investigated. Scanning electron microscopy observations demonstrated a more uniform distribution of the CNTs for samples prepared following a processing route based on polymer ball milling and CNT dispersion in ethanol media. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of the matrix by the incorporation of SWCNTs. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the crystallization temperature with increasing SWCNT content, whilst no significant changes were observed in the melting of the composites. The crystallite size determined by X-ray diffraction decreased at high SWCNT loading, which is attributed to the spatial limitations on crystal growth by confinement within the CNT network. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed an increase in the storage moduli, hence in the rigidity of the systems, with increasing SWCNT content. Their addition shifts the glass transition peak to higher temperatures due to the restriction in chain mobility imposed by the CNTs. Higher thermal stability and mechanical strength were found for composites with improved dispersion of the SWCNTs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Processing techniques such as direct, sonication, shear, and combined sonication and shear mixing techniques were employed in the fabrication of nanocomposites. It was found that both sonication and shear mixing produced in situ nanosize graphite sheets from EG. However, the occurrence of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at 2$\theta$ = 26.38° (d0 0 2 = 3.37 {\AA}) irrespective of processing technique confirmed the presence of graphite nanosheets in multilayer rather than a single layer form. The mechanical behavior of the nanocomposites was investigated as a function of particle concentration and processing technique. It was found that EG reinforced nanocomposites showed higher elastic modulus than neat epoxy. However, nanocomposites prepared with the aid of shear mixing provided the best exfoliation and dispersion of graphite nanosheets and as a consequence, the best modulus enhancement over other processing techniques. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this work two types of montmorillonite, a pristine and an organo-modified clay (Cloisite 30B), were employed to produce (polyethylene terephthalate)-based nanocomposites via in situ polymerization. Using water as an intermediate medium, a stable dispersion of pristine clay in ethylene glycol was achieved. However, after polymerization, no significant gain was obtained in terms of delamination of silicate platelets. The polycondensation reaction when using Cloisite 30B was carried out at a temperature as low as 250°C in order to retain a considerable portion of the organo-modifier. The results showed that Cloisite 30B was successfully intercalated by the polymer chains, resulting in a d-spacing increase from 1.9 nm to about 3.6 nm. Although some mono and double silicate layers were observed in microscopy images, the major part of the organoclay remained in a tactoid intercalated form. Sampling during the polycondensation reaction revealed that, in this process, clay was first swelled efficiently by the monomer, and this structure was preserved in the early stage of polycondensation. However, the silicate platelets collapsed with time as the polycondensation progressed and larger molecular weight oligomers were formed. An investigation on the type of impeller used in the polymerization process showed that a slight improvement was achieved in terms of aggregate size and distribution when the anchor impeller was replaced by a helical one.},

A low percentage of nanosized conductive carbon filler (carbon black and graphite) or ions (Li+, Na+ and K +) was filled into the tunnelling phase of expanded graphite (EG) sheets, by which electron transport was enhanced across the junctions of EG sheets and a significant increase in the electrical conductivity of the composites was achieved. In this report, polyethylene (PE) and polyethersulphone (PES) were selected as model materials. The results indicated that for the EG/PE composite the conductive peculation threshold was less than 2 wt{\%} and its conductivity increased three orders of magnitude with the addition of only 1 wt{\%} nanofiller compared with the EG/PE composite. By introducing a very small amount of Li+ or Na+ (0.06 wt{\%} related to EG) the electrical conductivity was further enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to the EG/PES composite. Experimental results were well understood by the theoretical study of the electron transport behaviour in the EG/polymer composites. The gaps between graphite sheets in the matrix must be no larger than 10 nm if the EG/PE composite is to become electrically conductive. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Characterization by SEM and TEM shows that surface functionalization of the nanowires resulted in significant dispersion of CuNWs in the PS matrix. The electrical characterization of the nanocomposites indicates that functionalized CuNWs start to form electrically conductive networks at lower concentrations (0.25 vol{\%} Cu) than using unfunctionalized CuNWs (0.5 vol{\%} Cu). The organic coating on the nanowires prevents significant changes in the electrical resistivity in the vicinity of the percolation threshold. Percolated nanocomposites showed electrical resistivity in the range of 10(6)-10(7) $\Omega$ cm. The transition from liquid-like to solid-like behavior (rheological percolation) of the nanocomposites was studied using dynamic rheology at 200 °C. Unfunctionalized CuNWs result in electrical and rheological percolation at similar concentrations. Functionalized CuNWs show rheological percolation at higher concentration (1.0-2.0 vol{\%}) than that required for electrical percolation. This is attributed to the decrease in the interfacial tension between nanowires and polymer chains and its effect on the viscoelastic behavior of the combined polymer-nanowire networks.},

abstract = {Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/high density polyethylene (HDPE) and graphene nanosheets (GNS)/HDPE composites with a segregated network structure were prepared by alcohol-assisted dispersion and hot-pressing. Instead of uniform dispersion in polymer matrix, MWCNTs and GNSs distributed along specific paths and formed a segregated conductive network, which results in a low electrical percolation threshold of the composites. The electrical properties of the GNS/HDPE and MWCNT/HDPE composites were comparatively studied, it was found that the percolation threshold of the GNS/HDPE composites (1 vol.{\%}) was much higher than that of the MWCNT/HDPE composites (0.15 vol.{\%}), and the MWCNT/HDPE composite shows higher electrical conductivity than GNS/HDPE composite at the same filler content. According to the values of critical exponent, t, the two composites may have different electrical conduction mechanisms: MWCNT/HDPE composite represents a three-dimensional conductive system, while the GNS/HDPE composite represents a two-dimensional conductive system. The improving effect of GNSs as conducting fillers on the electrical conductivity of their composites is far lower than theoretically expected. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have generated significant academic and industrial interest for several decades. Unfortunately, ordinary CPCs with random conductive networks generally require high conductive filler loadings at the insulator/conductor transition, requiring complex processing and exhibiting inferior mechanical properties and low economic affordability. Segregated CPC (s-CPC) contains conductive fillers that are segregated in the perimeters of the polymeric granules instead of being randomly distributed throughout the bulk CPC material; these materials are overwhelmingly superior compared to normal CPCs. For example, the s-CPC materials have an ultralow percolation concentration (0.005-0.1 vol{\%}), superior electrical conductivity (up to 106 S/m), and reasonable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (above 20 dB) at low filler loadings. Therefore, considerable progress has been achieved with s-CPCs, including high-performance anti-static, EMI shielding and sensing materials. Currently, however, few systematic reviews summarizing these advances with s-CPCs are available. To understand and efficiently harness the abilities of s-CPCs, we attempted to review the major advances available in the literature. This review begins with a concise and general background on the morphology and fabrication methods of s-CPCs. Next, we investigate the ultralow percolation behaviors of and the elements exerting a relevant influence (e.g., conductive filler type, host polymers, dispersion methods, etc.) on s-CPCs. Moreover, we also briefly discussed the latest advances in the mechanical, sensing, thermoelectric and EMI shielding properties of the s-CPCs. Finally, an overview of the current challenges and tasks of s-CPC materials is provided to guide the future development of these promising materials. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Information security underpins many aspects of modern society. However, silicon chips are vulnerable to hazards such as counterfeiting, tampering and information leakage through side-channel attacks (for example, by measuring power consumption, timing or electromagnetic radiation). Single-walled carbon nanotubes are a potential replacement for silicon as the channel material of transistors due to their superb electrical properties and intrinsic ultrathin body, but problems such as limited semiconducting purity and non-ideal assembly still need to be addressed before they can deliver high-performance electronics. Here, we show that by using these inherent imperfections, an unclonable electronic random structure can be constructed at low cost from carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are self-assembled into patterned HfO2 trenches using ion-exchange chemistry, and the width of the trench is optimized to maximize the randomness of the nanotube placement. With this approach, two-dimensional (2D) random bit arrays are created that can offer ternary-bit architecture by determining the connection yield and switching type of the nanotube devices. As a result, our cryptographic keys provide a significantly higher level of security than conventional binary-bit architecture with the same key size.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of large aspect ratio and multifunctional conductive fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplates, etc., conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have attracted increasing attention. Although the morphological control of conductive networks in CPCs has been extensively investigated as an important issue for the preparation of high performance CPCs, recent extensive progress has not been systematically addressed in any review. It has been observed that the morphological control of conductive networks during the preparation of CPCs has crucial influence on the electrical properties of these composites. Several methods have been shown to be able to control the network structure, and thus, tune the electrical properties of CPCs, including the use of shear, polymer blends, thermal annealing, mixed filler, latex particle etc. Moreover, many novel and exciting applications have been extensively investigated for CPCs, such as stretchable conductor, electroactive sensors, shape memory materials and thermoelectric materials, etc. Therefore, the morphological control of conductive network in CPCs is reviewed here. Issues regarding morphology characterization methods, morphological control methods, resulted network morphology and electrical properties are discussed. Furthermore, the use of CPCs as electroactive multifunctional materials is also reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets or buckypapers have demonstrated promising electrical conductivity and mechanical performance. However, their electrical conductivity is still far below the requirements for engineering applications, such as using as a substitute for copper mesh, which is currently used in composite aircraft structures for lightning strike protection. In this study, different CNT buckypapers were stretched to increase their alignment, and then subjected to conjugational cross-linking via chemical functionalization. The conjugationally cross-linked buckypapers (CCL-BPs) demonstrated higher electrical conductivity of up to 6200 S cm( - 1), which is more than one order increase compared to the pristine buckypapers. The CCL-BPs also showed excellent doping stability in over 300 h in atmosphere and were resistant to degradation at elevated temperatures. The tensile strength of the stretched CCL-BPs reached 220 MPa, which is about three times that of pristine buckypapers. We attribute these property improvements to the effective and stable conjugational cross-links of CNTs, which can simultaneously improve the electrical conductivity, doping stability and mechanical properties. Specifically, the electrical conductivity increase resulted from improving the CNT alignment and inter-tube electron transport capability. The conjugational cross-links provide effective 3D conductive paths to increase the mobility of electrons among individual nanotubes. The stable covalent bonding also enhances the thermal stability and load transfer. The significant electrical and mechanical property improvement renders buckypaper a multifunctional material for various applications, such as conducting composites, battery electrodes, capacitors, etc.},

A special specimen geometry, the skin/stringer configuration, was used to represent a typical reinforced aerospace structural joint. The specimens consisted of a flange, representing a stringer or frame, welded onto a skin laminate. The effects of the welding parameters such as the input power level and clamping distance on the weld quality and performance were investigated. The welding parameters were optimised using short beam shear tests, ultrasonic C-scan inspection and optical microscopy. The mechanical performance of the resistance-welded skin/stringer configuration was investigated using three- and four-point bending tests and the failure mechanisms were characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Two methods were used to reduce the stress concentration at the flange tip. The first method was to machine a 20° taper angle at the edge of the flange and the second one was to create a resin fillet at the flange tip. No mechanical performance improvement was obtained with the resin fillet method but the taper angle method showed 25{\%} mechanical performance improvement when the taper angles were machined after the welding operation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we review recent progress and advances that have been made on: (a) dispersion of CNTs in a polymer matrix, including optimum blending, in situ polymerization and chemical functionalization; and (b) alignment of CNTs in the matrix enhanced by ex situ techniques, force and magnetic fields, electrospinning and liquid crystalline phase-induced methods. In addition, discussions on mechanical, thermal, electrical, electrochemical, optical and super-hydrophobic properties; and applications of polymer/CNT composites are included. Enhanced dispersion and alignment of CNTs in the polymer matrix will promote and extend the applications and developments of polymer/CNT nanocomposites. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Spot-welded specimens showed comparable onset failure load and significantly higher joint stiffness compared to mechanical fasteners when carrying shear load. The failure modes and the damage within specimens were analysed after mechanical tests. Intralaminar failure and very limited damage on the out-most ply were found for welded specimens, whereas catastrophic through-the-thickness failure was observed for mechanically fastened joints. Based on the experimental outcomes, the mechanical performance and failure mechanisms of spot-welded joints were critically assessed in comparison to the mechanical fasteners.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

For the experimental analysis, EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of MWCNT/polypropylene (PP) composite plates made in three different thicknesses and at four different concentrations were studied. A model based on the shielding of electromagnetic plane wave was used to theoretically study the EMI shielding mechanisms. The experimental results showed that absorption is the major shielding mechanism and reflection is the secondary shielding mechanism. The modeling results demonstrated that multiple-reflection within MWCNT internal surfaces and between MWCNT external surfaces decrease the overall EMI SE. The EMI SE of MWCNT/PP composites increased with increase in MWCNT content and shielding plate thickness. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {By using a latex-based technology, it is possible to homogeneously disperse single and multi wall carbon nanotubes (NTs) within most of the polymers that are produced by emulsion polymerization, or that can be brought into the form of an emulsion. The first step of the process consists of exfoliating NTs in an aqueous surfactant solution. This step can be monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Four experimental techniques have been developed in order to determine the minimum amount of surfactant, which is necessary to reach the highest degree of exfoliation of the NTs. The key step of this latex-based process is mixing a stable dispersion of NTs, covered by surfactant molecules, with a polymer latex. The use of this technology results in conductive nanocomposites with a low percolation threshold. Several procedures were explored in order to improve the properties of the materials, like tuning the characteristics of the polymer matrix.},

abstract = {Buckypaper is a thin sheet fabricated from the aggregation of carbon nanotubes. The generally accepted method for forming such carbon nanotube (CNT) films involves the use of stable suspension of carbon nanotubes in water. These suspensions can then be membrane-filtered under pressure to yield uniform films. After preparation of a stable solution, it should be membrane-filtrated on the surface of a filter. Usually, the quality of a buckypaper depends on sonication time and power, surfactant type and concentration, filter type, and concentration of carbon nanotube. In order to investigate the surface quality of buckypapers, low-magnification images could give rather useful information about the roughness of surface. Analysis of the 100 × images clearly shows that with increasing the suspension concentration, the smoothness of buckypaper surface will decrease. Therefore, from this viewpoint, decreasing the concentration can enhance the quality of the buckypaper. Surface of the filter also affects on the buckypaper quality. Therefore, for filtration of the suspension, a filter with suitable material, pore sizes, and surface should be used. As the pore sizes of the filter are usually small, the filtration process may be very time-consuming. Since the process is carring out under pressure and also due to the brittle nature of the buckypaper, removal of the buckypaper from the surface of the filter is a very serious and important stage and depends on the filter type, concentration, and type of CNTs. The buckypaper usually can be removed from the filter mechanically. The type of CNTs (MWNT or SWNT) may change the above-mentioned factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Cyclohexanol and xylene were used as carbon precursors, for synthesis of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) arrays in a CVD system at temperature of 750 ??C, using nitrogen as carrier gas and ferrocene as catalyst. Different characterization methods were employed to compare the MWCNTs structure synthesized by these two precursors. All scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman spectroscopy results illustrated that using cyclohexanol could significantly reduce formation of amorphous carbon and catalyst particles in the as-grown CNTs. The less amorphous carbon can be attributed to in situ oxidation in presence of oxygen atom of cyclohexanol. Characterizations showed that MWCNTs with high purity could be obtained using cyclohexanol as carbon precursor. The as-grown MWCNTs were purified by oxidation and acid treatment. Characterization of the purified MWCNTs using HNO 3/H 2SO 4 (1/3 or 1/1), 8 M HCl or 8 M HNO 3 was carried out. The results showed that 8 M HNO 3 could be considered as the best chemical to obtain more pure MWCNTs, less amorphous and metal particles and less damaged MWCNTs. The Raman spectroscopy results demonstrated that HNO 3/H 2SO 4 (1/3) treatment could more disorder the MWCNTs structure and this was attributed to the bigger destroying effect of this acid treatment. Furthermore, the TEM analysis of MWCNTs before and after acid treatment revealed that acid treatment could remove encapsulated catalyst particles. The FTIR analysis illustrated that purification of the MWCNTs with nitric acid could connect the functional groups onto the outer surface of MWCNTs and this resulted in more dispersion of the MWCNTs in water. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The production of high quality single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on a bulk scale has been an issue of considerable interest. Recently, it has been demonstrated that high quality SWCNTs can be continuously synthesized on large scale by using induction thermal plasma technology. In this process, the high energy density of the thermal plasma is employed to generate dense vapor-phase precursors for the synthesis of SWCNTs. With the current reactor system, a carbon soot product which contains approximately 40 wt{\%} of SWCNTs can be continuously synthesized at the high production rate of 100 g/h. In this article, our recent research efforts to achieve major advances in this technology are presented. Firstly, the processing parameters involved are examined systematically in order to evaluate their individual influences on the SWCNT synthesis. Based on these results, the appropriate operating conditions of the induction thermal plasma process for an effective synthesis of SWCNTs are discussed. A characterization study has also been performed on the SWCNTs produced under the optimum processing conditions. Finally, a mathematical model of the process currently under development is described. The model will help us to better understand the synthesis of SWCNTs in the induction plasma process.},

A comparative study of multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyethylene (MWCNT/PE) composites produced by different methods (thermal mechanical mixing, coagulation precipitation technique and in situ ethylene polymerization with a Ziegler–Natta catalyst supported on MWCNTs) has been performed. The morphology and structure of the produced composites were investigated by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopies. MWCNT incorporation into PE matrix results in the change of conductivity mechanism from conductivity typical of a system with local disorder and effects of weak interaction of electrons (quantum correction to conductivity) to conductivity that can be described within the theory of Coulomb blockade or quasi-one-dimensional variable-range hopping conductivity with variable length of hops (Mott's law) between localized states. The electromagnetic (EM) response of composites was investigated in a broadband region (118–510 GHz). It was found that the dielectric properties of MWCNT/PE composites correlate with their electrophysical properties determined by the MWCNT distribution within the polymer matrix.

The data obtained indicate that the treatment gives considerable oxidation and improved wettability for PE and PEEK surface types. Treated surfaces were analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angles. XPS was also used to follow the chemistry and mechanism of the oxidation. Adhesion with a two-part epoxy was measured for PE and PEEK and was observed to improve significantly after pretreatment.},

abstract = {Non-modified Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) and polypropylene (PP) in absence of compatibilizer have been chosen to elaborate MWCNT/PP nanocomposites using a simple melt-mixing dispersing method. Calorimetry results indicate little effect of MWCNTs on crystallinity of PP, revealing not much interaction between nanotubes and PP chains, which is compatible with the employed manufacturing procedure. In any case, a hindering of polymer chains motion by MWCNTs is observed in the molten state, using oscillatory flow experiments, and a rheological percolation threshold is determined. The percolation limit is not noticed by Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) measurements in the melt, because this technique rather detects local motions. Keeping the nanocomposites in the molten state provokes an electrical conductivity increase of several orders of magnitude, but on ulterior crystallization, the conductivity decreases, probably due to a reduction of the ionic conductivity. For a concentration of 2{\%} MWCNTs, in the limit of percolation, the conductivity decreases considerably more, because percolation network constituted in the molten state is unstable and is destroyed during crystallization.},

@article{Ma2011,
abstract = {This paper proposes the correlation between the electrokinetic potential, dispersibility in solvents, surface energy and oxygen content of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) affected by functionalization. Colloidal systems consisting of CNTs with varying degrees of dispersion are prepared and characterized to evaluate CNT dispersibility and suspension stability in solvents with different polarities. The results show that an absolute value of zeta potential at about 25. mV is closely related to the micro- and macroscopic dispersion of CNTs, whereas a high absolute value of 40. mV is regarded as an indication of high quality CNT dispersion with much enhanced suspension stability in solvents. The absolute zeta potential value increases consistently with increasing degree of CNT functionality, the increase being most pronounced in a hydrophilic liquid such as water. A linear correlation is established between the surface energy of a CNT film and the oxygen to carbon ratio of CNT surface. The CNT dispersibility in a liquid is determined not only by their physical states, but also by the hydrophilicity and surface functionality of CNTs, all of which are reflected by zeta potential. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon materials are, in general, very good absorbents of microwaves, i.e., they are easily heated by microwave radiation. This characteristic allows them to be transformed by microwave heating, giving rise to new carbons with tailored properties, to be used as microwave receptors, in order to heat other materials indirectly, or to act as a catalyst and microwave receptor in different heterogeneous reactions. In recent years, the number of processes that combine the use of carbons and microwave heating instead of other methods based on conventional heating has increased. In this paper some of the microwave-assisted processes in which carbon materials are produced, transformed or used in thermal treatments (generally, as microwave absorbers and catalysts) are reviewed and the main achievements of this technique are compared with those obtained by means of conventional (non microwave-assisted) methods in similar conditions.},

abstract = {Resistance welding has been demonstrated as a viable technique for joining thermoplastic composites. Extensive research has been conducted in previous studies on the processing and postprocessing evaluation of coupon-sized resistance welded specimens using this thermoplastic fusion bonding technique. This work focuses on the manufacturing and evaluation of large-scale resistance welds used to join carbon fiber (CF)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) thermoplastic composite parts. Applications using the present resistance welding technology are assessed, and potential applications of resistance welding are discussed. The sequential resistance welding process is introduced as an approach to large-scale welding that increases joint quality and performance while maintaining modest pressure and weld power requirements. The single-step and alternate multiple-step (sequential) techniques are implemented for large-scale resistance welds of CF/PEEK adherends comolded with polyetherimide (PEI) (i.e., the Thermabond{\textregistered} process). Nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, mechanical testing, fractography, and microscopy show that: (1) a higher weld uniformity was obtained with the multiple-step weld than the single-step weld; and (2) uneven heating and overheating were minimized by reducing the heating element length within the bond region through the use of the sequential resistance welding process. The different welding techniques produce a large variation in lap shear strength; direct comparison of the weld quality and lap shear strength shows that the sequential resistance welding process yields a superior bond. With the principles developed in this investigation, resistance welding can be used to join large-scale thermoplastic composite parts with consistent, high levels of performance and quality.},

abstract = {Microwave-absorbing materials find application in telecommunications, microwave heating and for representing the behavior of biological tissue in the presence of microwave radiation. Commonly, such materials are formed using ferromagnetic filler particles and rely on the phenomenon of ferromagnetic resonance for absorption of microwaves. Dielectric loss at microwave frequencies can be engineered through creating a phase lag, with respect to the applied electric field, of the movement of free charges in a composite formed using metal-coated filler particles. These materials can be engineered to be less dense and, therefore, more lightweight than those formed with ferromagnetic fillers, which is an advantage in some applications. Furthermore, theory shows that the frequency of maximum absorption can be tailored by selecting the conductivity and thickness of the particle coating although, in practice, it may be difficult to fabricate particles with tightly controlled physical parameters. In this work, theories for calculating complex permittivity of composites with layered filler particles are reviewed, and experimental observations of dielectric relaxation in composites formed by dispersing tungsten-coated glass bubbles in paraffin wax are shown},

abstract = {Hydrophilic and hydrophobic thin films have been deposited onto flat metallic substrates through photo-initiated chemical vapor deposition (PICVD), using syngas as a precursor, and affordable UVC germicidal lamps as a source of light. This study is the first experimental investigation of what has been previously concluded to be the potential solution to the current widespread nanoparticle functionalization problem. This study addresses the current limiting factor, namely the cost issue, by using simple gas precursors, using an affordable initiation source and operating under normal conditions. This approach differs from the current approaches which use expensive solvents as precursors, energy consuming-sources of initiation (e.g. high temperature, plasma and VUV) and operate under high vacuum and/or high temperatures. While the current paradigm is to target the peak absorption of a molecule, the present study indicates that long chain polymerized products can be formed from off-peak wavelengths. It has been found that photo-initiated deposition occurs and that a wide range of water contact angles, from 5° to 118°, can be obtained by manipulating the experimental conditions. A multilinear empirical model has been derived, and it predicts fairly well the contact angles obtained as a function of the different experimental parameters.},
