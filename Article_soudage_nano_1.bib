abstract = {The introduction of graphene-based nanomaterials has prompted the development of flexible nanocomposites for emerging applications in need of superior mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, and chemical performance. These nanocomposites exhibit outstanding structural performance and multifunctional properties by synergistically combining the characteristics of both components if proper structural and interfacial organization is achieved. Here, we briefly introduce the material designs and basic interfacial interactions in the graphene-polymer nanocomposites and the corresponding theoretical models for predicting the mechanical performances of such nanocomposites. Then, we discuss various assembly techniques available for effectively incorporating the strong and flexible graphene-based components into polymer matrices by utilization of weak and strong interfacial interactions available in functionalized graphene sheets. We discuss mechanical performance and briefly summarize other physical (thermal, electrical, barrier, and optical) properties, which are controlled by processing conditions and interfacial interactions. Finally, we present a brief outlook of the developments in graphene-based polymer nanocomposites by discussing the major progress, opportunities, and challenges. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study investigates the fatigue performance of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites. Lap shear specimens consisting of unidirectional carbon fibre/poly-ether-imide (CF/PEI), unidirectional carbon fibre/poly-ether-ketone-ketone (CF/PEKK) and 8-harness satin weave fabric glass fibre/poly-ether-imide (GF/PEI) composites were resistance-welded using a metal mesh heating element. The specimens were fatigue-tested at various percentages of their static lap shear strengths at a load ratio R = 0.1 and frequency f = 5 Hz. The fatigue performances of resistance-welded semi-crystalline (PEKK) and amorphous (PEI) composites were compared and the failure modes of the specimens were described. The stiffness degradation was monitored during the tests in order to evaluate the damage accumulation in the specimens. Linear stress-life (S-N) curves were obtained for all three materials when plotted on a semi-log scale. Interlaminar failure modes, involving tearing of the heating element and damage to the adherends were observed. The indefinite fatigue lives of CF/PEKK and CF/PEI welded specimens were obtained at 25{\%} of their static lap shear strengths. The indefinite fatigue life of the GF/PEI welded specimens was obtained at 20{\%} of the static lap shear strength. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{McKnight1997,
abstract = {Resistance welding has been demonstrated as a viable technique for joining thermoplastic composites. Extensive research has been conducted in previous studies on the processing and postprocessing evaluation of coupon-sized resistance welded specimens using this thermoplastic fusion bonding technique. This work focuses on the manufacturing and evaluation of large-scale resistance welds used to join carbon fiber (CF)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) thermoplastic composite parts. Applications using the present resistance welding technology are assessed, and potential applications of resistance welding are discussed. The sequential resistance welding process is introduced as an approach to large-scale welding that increases joint quality and performance while maintaining modest pressure and weld power requirements. The single-step and alternate multiple-step (sequential) techniques are implemented for large-scale resistance welds of CF/PEEK adherends comolded with polyetherimide (PEI) (i.e., the Thermabond{\textregistered} process). Nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, mechanical testing, fractography, and microscopy show that: (1) a higher weld uniformity was obtained with the multiple-step weld than the single-step weld; and (2) uneven heating and overheating were minimized by reducing the heating element length within the bond region through the use of the sequential resistance welding process. The different welding techniques produce a large variation in lap shear strength; direct comparison of the weld quality and lap shear strength shows that the sequential resistance welding process yields a superior bond. With the principles developed in this investigation, resistance welding can be used to join large-scale thermoplastic composite parts with consistent, high levels of performance and quality.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation characterising the fatigue failure mechanisms of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites skin/stringer joints is presented. Unidirectional (UD) and quasi-isotropic adherends were welded using stainless steel meshes as heating elements. The specimen geometry consisted of a flange laminate, representing a stringer, welded onto a skin laminate. In order to avoid current leakage to the electrically conductive adherends, a ceramic-coated heating element (TiO2 HE) was used for welding the UD specimens and some of the quasi-isotropic specimens. The fatigue performance of the welded joints was investigated under three-point bending. An indefinite fatigue life was obtained at 40{\%} and 35{\%} of the static damage initiation load for the UD and quasi-isotropic specimens, respectively. The failure mechanisms were documented based on observation of the fatigue cracks initiation and growth. UD specimens failed at the weld interface while quasi-isotropic specimens showed delaminations both in the flange or skin laminates and at the weld interface. The TiO2 HE did not show any fatigue mechanical performance reduction. However, debonding at the weld interface was shown to occur between the metal mesh wires and the TiO2 coating instead of between the laminates and the weld. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimens consisted of a flange, representing a stringer or frame, welded onto a skin laminate. The effects of the welding parameters such as the input power level and clamping distance on the weld quality and performance were investigated. The welding parameters were optimised using short beam shear tests, ultrasonic C-scan inspection and optical microscopy. The mechanical performance of the resistance-welded skin/stringer configuration was investigated using three- and four-point bending tests and the failure mechanisms were characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Two methods were used to reduce the stress concentration at the flange tip. The first method was to machine a 20° taper angle at the edge of the flange and the second one was to create a resin fillet at the flange tip. No mechanical performance improvement was obtained with the resin fillet method but the taper angle method showed 25{\%} mechanical performance improvement when the taper angles were machined after the welding operation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Non-modified Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) and polypropylene (PP) in absence of compatibilizer have been chosen to elaborate MWCNT/PP nanocomposites using a simple melt-mixing dispersing method. Calorimetry results indicate little effect of MWCNTs on crystallinity of PP, revealing not much interaction between nanotubes and PP chains, which is compatible with the employed manufacturing procedure. In any case, a hindering of polymer chains motion by MWCNTs is observed in the molten state, using oscillatory flow experiments, and a rheological percolation threshold is determined. The percolation limit is not noticed by Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) measurements in the melt, because this technique rather detects local motions. Keeping the nanocomposites in the molten state provokes an electrical conductivity increase of several orders of magnitude, but on ulterior crystallization, the conductivity decreases, probably due to a reduction of the ionic conductivity. For a concentration of 2{\%} MWCNTs, in the limit of percolation, the conductivity decreases considerably more, because percolation network constituted in the molten state is unstable and is destroyed during crystallization.},

It is demonstrated that advances in materials and processing technology and understanding has enabled much of the progress that has been made since the inception of manned, heavier than air flight. The recent constraints of cost, as determined by customer value, have changed the way new materials are introduced and these trends appear to be the new paradigm for the aircraft and aircraft engine industry. While the focus of this paper is aircraft and aircraft engines, the broader focus is on the role of materials in creating lightweight structures. There are examples used in this paper that are relevant to automotive applications once they are adjusted for cost. This matter is briefly discussed at the end of the paper.},

Experimental results show that the GF/PEI prepreg could effectively prevent current leakage and enlarge the welding area. Welding parameters, such as input power level, welding time and pressure, were optimized according to the results of mechanical and microstructure characterization. Mechanical performance of composite specimens joined using metal mesh, in terms of lap shear strength and Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, was equivalent to that of compression moulded benchmarks. Fracture surfaces of welded specimens showed mostly cohesive failure or intralaminar failure, indicating that good bonding between the PEI matrix and metal mesh was achieved.},

The optimum resistance welding time based on a criterion of maximum lap shear strength was determined. The time required to achieve intimate contact predicted by a three-dimensional transient finite-element model featuring heat transfer and consolidation correlated well with the optimal welding time. The influence of the welding pressure on lap shear strength was investigated, and the consolidation quality obtained in the welded joint was related to the processing conditions. The extent of flow occurring during welding, or the reduction of thickness of the welded joints, was shown to be related to lap shear strength. Four failure mechanisms, leading to different values of lap shear strength, were identi{\textregistered}ed including interfacial failure, cohesive failure of the heating element, tearing of the heating element and tearing of the laminate. Experimental and numerical processing windows were constructed and correlated well to each other. A comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements, in terms of lap shear strength and the interlaminar fracture toughness, GIc, was performed. It was demonstrated that large-scale lap-shear coupons and double cantilever beam specimens can be resistance welded providing that current leaking to the laminate is avoided.},

Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated better SWCNT dispersion for samples with polysulfone. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of PEEK/glass fiber by the incorporation of SWCNTs wrapped in the compatibilizer, ascribed to a significant thermal conductivity enhancement. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the crystallization temperature and crystallinity of the polymer with the addition of both wrapped and non-wrapped SWCNTs. The laminates exhibit anisotropic electrical behavior; their conductivity out-of-plane is lower than that in-plane. Dynamic mechanical studies revealed an increase in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature in the presence of polysulfone. Mechanical tests demonstrated significant enhancements in stiffness, strength and toughness by the incorporation of wrapped nanofillers, whilst the mechanical properties of non-compatibilized composites only improved marginally. Samples with laser-grown SWCNTs exhibit enhanced overall performance. This investigation confirms that SWCNT-reinforced PEEK/glass fiber compatibilized composites possess excellent potential to be used as multifunctional engineering materials in industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The development of polymer based conductive composites is required in aeronautical applications where electrostatic charges and heat need to be evacuated. Optimization of conductive filler content is necessary to maintain low density and high mechanical properties provided by the polymer matrix. We introduced silver nanoparticles in Polyetheretherketone. Electrical conductivity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity have been determined as a function of filler content and temperature. In particular, we studied the influence of silver nanoparticles aspect ratio on these thermal properties. We compared nanospheres with nanowires. A low electrical percolation threshold (0.55 vol{\%}) is obtained for silver nanowires composites compared to spherical particles (10.8 vol{\%}). Thermal conductivity increases with silver content and the influence of filler aspect ratio is interesting: thanks to nanowires, the thermal conductivity enhancement is reached for lower silver content. Experimental data are well fitted with Nan model. Specific heat capacity decreases with the introduction of silver nanoparticles, following the mixture rule independently of aspect ratio. Composites thermal diffusivity also increases with increasing silver content and influence of filler aspect ratio can be brought to light. Temperature dependence of these thermal properties indicate a dominant heat transport mechanism typical of disordered materials},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the influence of carbon nanotube (CNT) characteristics on the electrical conductivity of polystyrene nanocomposites produced using a latex-based approach. We processed both industrially-produced multi-wall CNT (MWCNT) powders and MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films made in-house, and demonstrate that while the raw CNTs are individualized and dispersed comparably within the polymer matrix, the electrical conductivity of the final nanocomposites differs significantly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the CNTs. Owing to their longer length after dispersion, the percolation threshold observed using MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films is five times lower than the value for industrially-produced MWCNT powders. Further, owing to the high structural quality of the CNTs from vertically-aligned films, the resulting composite films exhibit electrical conductivity of 10(3) S m(-1) at 2 wt{\%} CNTs. On the contrary, composites made using the industrially-produced CNTs exhibit conductivity of only tens of S m(-1). To our knowledge, the measured electrical conductivity for CNT/PS composites using CNTs from vertically-aligned films is by far the highest value yet reported for CNT/PS nanocomposites at this loading.},

abstract = {During the past 20 years, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have become an important industrial material. Hundreds of tons are produced each year. This review is a survey of the scientific literature, motivated by industrial requirements and guidelines for environment, health and safety compliance. Sampling, size, area, density, color, crystallinity, as well as purity compared to properties of non-MWCNT carbon and catalyst metals, are presented. No single measurement tool provides a complete characterization; therefore, we summarize methods that include scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fast Fourier transform of high-resolution TEM, Raman spectroscopy, reflectance and thermogravimetric analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals information with regard to functional groups interacting the tube surface. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis is reviewed as the basis for evaluating specific surface area. We extend the review by presenting taxonomy of defects present in MWCNTs. Finally, we provide an appendix from documentary standards that are pertinent and reasonable for bulk measurements. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A highly flexible and transparent heater was developed from a composite electrode comprising silver nanowires (AgNWs) and a conductive polymer (CP) embedded in a colorless polyimide (cPI) film by a solution-processed inverted layer-by-layer processing method. The resulting CP-AgNW/cPI heater was mechanically stable with increases in resistance of {\textless}10{\%} under long-term cyclic bending to a curvature radius of 500 $\mu$m for up to 50,000 cycles. A roughness measurement revealed that the high flexibility originated from the electrodes being fully embedded at the surface of the polymer. The fabricated electrode was rapidly heated from room temperature to steady-state temperature within 40 s, with a peak temperature exceeding 200 °C. AgNW hybridization with CP layers was more efficient at lower NW densities, demonstrated by comparisons between the measured and calculated sheet resistance (Rs) of the electrodes. The addition of CP to the existing AgNW electrodes enhanced the steady-state temperature and current-carrying capacity of the fabricated heaters. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the proposed method of inverted layer-by-layer processing of AgNWs and CP is suitable to achieve a highly reliable and efficient transparent heater.},

Upon crystallization, PEEK segregates from the miscible amorphous state, causing a shift in the composition of the amorphous phase. PEI is found to be located outside the crystalline lamellae of PEEK. Correspondingly, the crystallinity of PEEK in the crystallized blends does not change largely with composition.},

@article{Cauchy2017,
abstract = {Noble-metal-coated carbon-based nanoparticles, when used as electrically conductive fillers, have the potential to provide excellent conductivity without the high weight and cost normally associated with metals such as silver and gold. To this effect, many attempts were made to deposit uniform metallic layers on core nanoparticles with an emphasis on silver for its high conductivity. The results so far were disheartening with the metal morphology being better described as a decoration than a coating with small effects on the electrical conductivity of the bulk particles. We tackled in this work the specific problem of electroless deposition of silver on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with the investigation of every step of the process. We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM), zeta potential, and electrical conductivity measurements to identify a repeatable, reliable set of parameters allowing for a uniform and fully connected silver deposition on the surface of the CNFs. The bulk particles' specific electrical conductivity (conductivity per unit mass) undergoes a more than 10-fold increase during the deposition, reaching 2500 S.cm2/g, which indicates that the added metal mass participates efficiently to the conduction network. The particles keep their high aspect ratio through the process, which enables a percolated conduction network at very low volume loadings in a composite. No byproducts are produced during the reaction so the particles do not have to be sorted or purified and can be used as produced after the short approximately 15 min reaction time. The particles might be an interesting replacement to conventional fillers in isotropic conductive adhesives, as a conductive network is obtained at a much lower loading. They might also serve as electrically conductive fillers in composites where a high conductivity is needed, such as lightning strike protection systems, or as high surface area silver electrodes.},

abstract = {Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK)/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites containing up to 17 wt{\%} filler were prepared using a twin screw extruder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the MWNTs were homogeneously dispersed in the PEEK matrix. Linear viscoelastic measurements show that both complex viscosity and moduli increase with increasing MWNT concentration. The storage modulus, G′ exhibits a dramatic seven order increase in magnitude around 1 wt{\%}, leading to a solid-like low-frequency behaviour at higher loadings; the effect can be attributed to network formation at a rheological percolation threshold. Rheotens measurements show that the melt strength also increases significantly on addition of nanotubes, however, the drawability decreases. An analytical Wagner model was used to calculate the apparent elongational viscosity over a wide range of elongational rates, and to reveal significant increases on addition of MWNTs, with a similar threshold behaviour. The electrical response is also dominated by percolation effects, increasing by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 10-11 to 10-1 S/cm, on the addition of only 2 wt{\%} MWNTs. In contrast, the thermal conductivity and tensile elastic modulus of the composites increased linearly with nanotube content, rising by 130{\%} and 50{\%}, at 17 wt{\%} MWNTs, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
