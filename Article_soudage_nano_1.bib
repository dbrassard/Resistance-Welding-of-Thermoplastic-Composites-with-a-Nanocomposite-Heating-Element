abstract = {The introduction of graphene-based nanomaterials has prompted the development of flexible nanocomposites for emerging applications in need of superior mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, and chemical performance. These nanocomposites exhibit outstanding structural performance and multifunctional properties by synergistically combining the characteristics of both components if proper structural and interfacial organization is achieved. Here, we briefly introduce the material designs and basic interfacial interactions in the graphene-polymer nanocomposites and the corresponding theoretical models for predicting the mechanical performances of such nanocomposites. Then, we discuss various assembly techniques available for effectively incorporating the strong and flexible graphene-based components into polymer matrices by utilization of weak and strong interfacial interactions available in functionalized graphene sheets. We discuss mechanical performance and briefly summarize other physical (thermal, electrical, barrier, and optical) properties, which are controlled by processing conditions and interfacial interactions. Finally, we present a brief outlook of the developments in graphene-based polymer nanocomposites by discussing the major progress, opportunities, and challenges. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reports a comparative study of the electrical and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of three carbon nanotube/polyethylene (CNT/PE) composites with different conductive networks, i.e., segregated structure (s-CNT/PE), partially segregated structure (p-CNT/PE) and randomly distributed structure (r-CNT/PE). The s-CNT/PE composite exhibits superior electrical conductivity up to 2 orders of magnitude over that of p-CNT/PE and r-CNT/PE composites, at the same CNT loading. Only 5 wt{\%} CNT addition in the s-CNT/PE composite realizes an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) as high as 46.4 dB, which is 20{\%} and 46{\%} higher than that for p-CNT/PE and r-CNT/PE composites, respectively. The selectively distributed CNTs at the interfaces between PE polyhedrons would certainly increase the effective CNT concentrations that form conducting pathways and thus increase the electrical conductivity and EMI SE in the s-CNT/PE composites. Such special structure also provides numerous interfaces that absorb the electromagnetic waves, resulting in an absorption-dominated shielding mechanism. Our work suggests that designing conductive networks in polymer composites is a promising approach to develop high-performance EMI shielding materials.},

abstract = {This paper examines the progress in aircraft and aircraft engines from the standpoint of the role that better materials and processing has played. Such progress includes the relatively recent transformation of the aircraft industry from purely performance driven products to products that are driven by customer value. It is demonstrated that advances in materials and processing technology and understanding has enabled much of the progress that has been made since the inception of manned, heavier than air flight. The recent constraints of cost, as determined by customer value, have changed the way new materials are introduced and these trends appear to be the new paradigm for the aircraft and aircraft engine industry. While the focus of this paper is aircraft and aircraft engines, the broader focus is on the role of materials in creating lightweight structures. There are examples used in this paper that are relevant to automotive applications once they are adjusted for cost. This matter is briefly discussed at the end of the paper.},

The electrical percolation threshold of the composite prepared by the dilution process followed by the compression molding was only 0.24 vol.{\%} CuNW.

Four different metal mesh sizes were used as heating elements. The samples were welded in a lap shear joint configuration and mechanically tested. Maximum Lap Shear Strengths of 52, 47 and 33 MPa were obtained for the CF/PEKK, CF/PEI and GF/PEI specimens, respectively. The ratio of the heating element's fraction of open area and wire diameter was shown to be the most important parameter to be considered when selecting an appropriate heating element size.},

abstract = {Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK)/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites containing up to 17 wt{\%} filler were prepared using a twin screw extruder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the MWNTs were homogeneously dispersed in the PEEK matrix. Linear viscoelastic measurements show that both complex viscosity and moduli increase with increasing MWNT concentration. The storage modulus, G′ exhibits a dramatic seven order increase in magnitude around 1 wt{\%}, leading to a solid-like low-frequency behaviour at higher loadings; the effect can be attributed to network formation at a rheological percolation threshold. Rheotens measurements show that the melt strength also increases significantly on addition of nanotubes, however, the drawability decreases. An analytical Wagner model was used to calculate the apparent elongational viscosity over a wide range of elongational rates, and to reveal significant increases on addition of MWNTs, with a similar threshold behaviour. The electrical response is also dominated by percolation effects, increasing by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 10-11 to 10-1 S/cm, on the addition of only 2 wt{\%} MWNTs. In contrast, the thermal conductivity and tensile elastic modulus of the composites increased linearly with nanotube content, rising by 130{\%} and 50{\%}, at 17 wt{\%} MWNTs, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{McKnight1997,
abstract = {Resistance welding has been demonstrated as a viable technique for joining thermoplastic composites. Extensive research has been conducted in previous studies on the processing and postprocessing evaluation of coupon-sized resistance welded specimens using this thermoplastic fusion bonding technique. This work focuses on the manufacturing and evaluation of large-scale resistance welds used to join carbon fiber (CF)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) thermoplastic composite parts. Applications using the present resistance welding technology are assessed, and potential applications of resistance welding are discussed. The sequential resistance welding process is introduced as an approach to large-scale welding that increases joint quality and performance while maintaining modest pressure and weld power requirements. The single-step and alternate multiple-step (sequential) techniques are implemented for large-scale resistance welds of CF/PEEK adherends comolded with polyetherimide (PEI) (i.e., the Thermabond{\textregistered} process). Nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, mechanical testing, fractography, and microscopy show that: (1) a higher weld uniformity was obtained with the multiple-step weld than the single-step weld; and (2) uneven heating and overheating were minimized by reducing the heating element length within the bond region through the use of the sequential resistance welding process. The different welding techniques produce a large variation in lap shear strength; direct comparison of the weld quality and lap shear strength shows that the sequential resistance welding process yields a superior bond. With the principles developed in this investigation, resistance welding can be used to join large-scale thermoplastic composite parts with consistent, high levels of performance and quality.},

Glass fibre fabric reinforced PEI (GF/PEI) was used as an electrical insulator between the heating element and adherend laminates. Experimental results show that the GF/PEI prepreg could effectively prevent current leakage and enlarge the welding area. Welding parameters, such as input power level, welding time and pressure, were optimized according to the results of mechanical and microstructure characterization. Mechanical performance of composite specimens joined using metal mesh, in terms of lap shear strength and Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, was equivalent to that of compression moulded benchmarks. Fracture surfaces of welded specimens showed mostly cohesive failure or intralaminar failure, indicating that good bonding between the PEI matrix and metal mesh was achieved.},

abstract = {Conductive Polymer Composite (CPC) can be considered one of the best material candidates for the bipolar plates in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells due to its balance between electrical and mechanical properties, low cost and ease of manufacturing. The development of the models has been shown to be important for predicting the electrical properties of the CPCs. The main challenge is to produce a constant electric supply in the fuel cell systems which influence the overall fuel cell performance. Generally, the classical percolation theory describes that the electrical conductivity of the polymer composite is achieved when the volume fraction of the conductive filler is above the specific value, known as percolation threshold phenomena. Current research trends using the General Effective Media (GEM) model show it is the best model to predict the electrical properties of the composite. The main advantage of using the GEM is the model can predict the electrical conductivity for multiple filler systems at high filler loadings. Numerous factors including volume fraction, shape and size, aspect ratio, critical value, and orientation are significant in developing a robust model. Controlling the filler orientations in the CPCs are important as they are able to improve the mechanical performance while enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composite. Orientation can be induced by a few methods such as shear stress, altering die and fillers aspect ratio based on the needs. By controlling the fillers direction, one is able to control both the mechanical and electrical conductivity of the CPCs. However, recent publications seem to suggest that the Fibre Contact Model (FCM) is the latest model that considers the orientation factor in predicting conductivity. A good agreement between experimental results and modelling prediction can be observed using carbon-fibre reinforced polypropylene below and above the percolation threshold. Parallel orientations of the fibres to the extrusion die direction provided better electrical conductivity compared to randomly oriented fillers. This manuscript attempts to discuss other potential models used in predicting the electrical conductivity of the CPCs.},

A comparative study of multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyethylene (MWCNT/PE) composites produced by different methods (thermal mechanical mixing, coagulation precipitation technique and in situ ethylene polymerization with a Ziegler–Natta catalyst supported on MWCNTs) has been performed. The morphology and structure of the produced composites were investigated by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopies. MWCNT incorporation into PE matrix results in the change of conductivity mechanism from conductivity typical of a system with local disorder and effects of weak interaction of electrons (quantum correction to conductivity) to conductivity that can be described within the theory of Coulomb blockade or quasi-one-dimensional variable-range hopping conductivity with variable length of hops (Mott's law) between localized states. The electromagnetic (EM) response of composites was investigated in a broadband region (118–510 GHz). It was found that the dielectric properties of MWCNT/PE composites correlate with their electrophysical properties determined by the MWCNT distribution within the polymer matrix.

abstract = {An experimental investigation of resistance welding of APC-2/AS4 PEEK/carbon fibre composite using a stainless steel mesh heating element is presented. A special specimen geometry, the skin/stringer configuration, was used to represent a typical reinforced aerospace structural joint. The specimens consisted of a flange, representing a stringer or frame, welded onto a skin laminate. The effects of the welding parameters such as the input power level and clamping distance on the weld quality and performance were investigated. The welding parameters were optimised using short beam shear tests, ultrasonic C-scan inspection and optical microscopy. The mechanical performance of the resistance-welded skin/stringer configuration was investigated using three- and four-point bending tests and the failure mechanisms were characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Two methods were used to reduce the stress concentration at the flange tip. The first method was to machine a 20° taper angle at the edge of the flange and the second one was to create a resin fillet at the flange tip. No mechanical performance improvement was obtained with the resin fillet method but the taper angle method showed 25{\%} mechanical performance improvement when the taper angles were machined after the welding operation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We processed both industrially-produced multi-wall CNT (MWCNT) powders and MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films made in-house, and demonstrate that while the raw CNTs are individualized and dispersed comparably within the polymer matrix, the electrical conductivity of the final nanocomposites differs significantly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the CNTs. Owing to their longer length after dispersion, the percolation threshold observed using MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films is five times lower than the value for industrially-produced MWCNT powders. Further, owing to the high structural quality of the CNTs from vertically-aligned films, the resulting composite films exhibit electrical conductivity of 10(3) S m(-1) at 2 wt{\%} CNTs. On the contrary, composites made using the industrially-produced CNTs exhibit conductivity of only tens of S m(-1). To our knowledge, the measured electrical conductivity for CNT/PS composites using CNTs from vertically-aligned films is by far the highest value yet reported for CNT/PS nanocomposites at this loading.},

abstract = {The development of polymer based conductive composites is required in aeronautical applications where electrostatic charges and heat need to be evacuated. Optimization of conductive filler content is necessary to maintain low density and high mechanical properties provided by the polymer matrix. We introduced silver nanoparticles in Polyetheretherketone. Electrical conductivity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity have been determined as a function of filler content and temperature. In particular, we studied the influence of silver nanoparticles aspect ratio on these thermal properties. We compared nanospheres with nanowires. A low electrical percolation threshold (0.55 vol{\%}) is obtained for silver nanowires composites compared to spherical particles (10.8 vol{\%}). Thermal conductivity increases with silver content and the influence of filler aspect ratio is interesting: thanks to nanowires, the thermal conductivity enhancement is reached for lower silver content. Experimental data are well fitted with Nan model. Specific heat capacity decreases with the introduction of silver nanoparticles, following the mixture rule independently of aspect ratio. Composites thermal diffusivity also increases with increasing silver content and influence of filler aspect ratio can be brought to light. Temperature dependence of these thermal properties indicate a dominant heat transport mechanism typical of disordered materials},

Amorphous PEEK was thermally annealed to produce a range of crystallinities, and its dielectric properties were measured. As the crystalline/amorphous ratio of the polymer increased, the dielectric breakdown strength was reduced. The electrical conductivity of the material was also shown to decrease with increasing crystallinity. The effect on the permittivity was inconclusive},

The optimum resistance welding time based on a criterion of maximum lap shear strength was determined. The time required to achieve intimate contact predicted by a three-dimensional transient finite-element model featuring heat transfer and consolidation correlated well with the optimal welding time. The influence of the welding pressure on lap shear strength was investigated, and the consolidation quality obtained in the welded joint was related to the processing conditions. The extent of flow occurring during welding, or the reduction of thickness of the welded joints, was shown to be related to lap shear strength. Four failure mechanisms, leading to different values of lap shear strength, were identi{\textregistered}ed including interfacial failure, cohesive failure of the heating element, tearing of the heating element and tearing of the laminate. Experimental and numerical processing windows were constructed and correlated well to each other. A comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements, in terms of lap shear strength and the interlaminar fracture toughness, GIc, was performed. It was demonstrated that large-scale lap-shear coupons and double cantilever beam specimens can be resistance welded providing that current leaking to the laminate is avoided.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation characterising the fatigue failure mechanisms of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites skin/stringer joints is presented. Unidirectional (UD) and quasi-isotropic adherends were welded using stainless steel meshes as heating elements. The specimen geometry consisted of a flange laminate, representing a stringer, welded onto a skin laminate. In order to avoid current leakage to the electrically conductive adherends, a ceramic-coated heating element (TiO2 HE) was used for welding the UD specimens and some of the quasi-isotropic specimens. The fatigue performance of the welded joints was investigated under three-point bending. An indefinite fatigue life was obtained at 40{\%} and 35{\%} of the static damage initiation load for the UD and quasi-isotropic specimens, respectively. The failure mechanisms were documented based on observation of the fatigue cracks initiation and growth. UD specimens failed at the weld interface while quasi-isotropic specimens showed delaminations both in the flange or skin laminates and at the weld interface. The TiO2 HE did not show any fatigue mechanical performance reduction. However, debonding at the weld interface was shown to occur between the metal mesh wires and the TiO2 coating instead of between the laminates and the weld. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This research explored the potential of using exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets, GNP, as the conductive filler to construct highly conductive polymeric nanocomposites to substitute for conventional metallic and graphite bipolar plates in the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was selected as the polymer matrix because of its high thermal and chemical tolerance. Solid state ball milling (SSBM) followed by compression molding was then applied to fabricate PPS/GNP nanocomposites. Results showed that PPS/GNP nanocomposites made by this method exhibit excellent mechanical and gas barrier properties but unsatisfied electrical conductivity. However, it was found that the electrical conductivity of these nanocomposites could be substantially enhanced if we combine GNP with second minor conductive filler for a positive synergistic effect and also optimize the processing time of SSBM. Meanwhile, PPS impregnated GNP papers were embedded into these PPS/GNP nanocomposites in order to further improve various properties of the resulting bipolar plates. It is believed that the bipolar plates made from PPS/GNP nanocomposites will allow lighter weight of PEM fuel cells with enhanced performance which is particularly suited for automotive applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Non-modified Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) and polypropylene (PP) in absence of compatibilizer have been chosen to elaborate MWCNT/PP nanocomposites using a simple melt-mixing dispersing method. Calorimetry results indicate little effect of MWCNTs on crystallinity of PP, revealing not much interaction between nanotubes and PP chains, which is compatible with the employed manufacturing procedure. In any case, a hindering of polymer chains motion by MWCNTs is observed in the molten state, using oscillatory flow experiments, and a rheological percolation threshold is determined. The percolation limit is not noticed by Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) measurements in the melt, because this technique rather detects local motions. Keeping the nanocomposites in the molten state provokes an electrical conductivity increase of several orders of magnitude, but on ulterior crystallization, the conductivity decreases, probably due to a reduction of the ionic conductivity. For a concentration of 2{\%} MWCNTs, in the limit of percolation, the conductivity decreases considerably more, because percolation network constituted in the molten state is unstable and is destroyed during crystallization.},

abstract = {The morphological, electrical and rheological characterization of polystyrene nanocomposites containing copper nanowires (CuNWs) functionalized with 1-octanethiol is presented. Characterization by SEM and TEM shows that surface functionalization of the nanowires resulted in significant dispersion of CuNWs in the PS matrix. The electrical characterization of the nanocomposites indicates that functionalized CuNWs start to form electrically conductive networks at lower concentrations (0.25 vol{\%} Cu) than using unfunctionalized CuNWs (0.5 vol{\%} Cu). The organic coating on the nanowires prevents significant changes in the electrical resistivity in the vicinity of the percolation threshold. Percolated nanocomposites showed electrical resistivity in the range of 10(6)-10(7) $\Omega$ cm. The transition from liquid-like to solid-like behavior (rheological percolation) of the nanocomposites was studied using dynamic rheology at 200 °C. Unfunctionalized CuNWs result in electrical and rheological percolation at similar concentrations. Functionalized CuNWs show rheological percolation at higher concentration (1.0-2.0 vol{\%}) than that required for electrical percolation. This is attributed to the decrease in the interfacial tension between nanowires and polymer chains and its effect on the viscoelastic behavior of the combined polymer-nanowire networks.},

The resulting CP-AgNW/cPI heater was mechanically stable with increases in resistance of {\textless}10{\%} under long-term cyclic bending to a curvature radius of 500 $\mu$m for up to 50,000 cycles. A roughness measurement revealed that the high flexibility originated from the electrodes being fully embedded at the surface of the polymer. The fabricated electrode was rapidly heated from room temperature to steady-state temperature within 40 s, with a peak temperature exceeding 200 °C. AgNW hybridization with CP layers was more efficient at lower NW densities, demonstrated by comparisons between the measured and calculated sheet resistance (Rs) of the electrodes. The addition of CP to the existing AgNW electrodes enhanced the steady-state temperature and current-carrying capacity of the fabricated heaters.

Key parameters for the recycled carbon fiber materials, including fiber volume fraction and fiber alignment, are investigated to identify beneficial uses of recycled carbon fiber in the automotive sector. Recycled carbon fiber components can achieve the lowest life cycle environmental impacts of all materials considered, although the actual impact is highly dependent on the design criteria ($\lambda$ value) of the specific component. Low production impacts associated with recycled carbon fiber components are observed relative to lightweight competitor materials (e.g., aluminum, virgin carbon fiber reinforced plastic). In addition, recycled carbon fiber components have low in-use energy use due to mass reductions and associated reduction in mass-induced fuel consumption. The results demonstrate environmental feasibility of the CFRP recycling materials, supporting the emerging commercialization of CF recycling technologies and identifying significant potential market opportunities in the automotive sector.},

Their morphology, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties were investigated and compared with the behavior of similar non-compatibilized composites. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated better SWCNT dispersion for samples with polysulfone. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of PEEK/glass fiber by the incorporation of SWCNTs wrapped in the compatibilizer, ascribed to a significant thermal conductivity enhancement. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the crystallization temperature and crystallinity of the polymer with the addition of both wrapped and non-wrapped SWCNTs. The laminates exhibit anisotropic electrical behavior; their conductivity out-of-plane is lower than that in-plane. Dynamic mechanical studies revealed an increase in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature in the presence of polysulfone. Mechanical tests demonstrated significant enhancements in stiffness, strength and toughness by the incorporation of wrapped nanofillers, whilst the mechanical properties of non-compatibilized composites only improved marginally. Samples with laser-grown SWCNTs exhibit enhanced overall performance.

abstract = {This study investigates the fatigue performance of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites. Lap shear specimens consisting of unidirectional carbon fibre/poly-ether-imide (CF/PEI), unidirectional carbon fibre/poly-ether-ketone-ketone (CF/PEKK) and 8-harness satin weave fabric glass fibre/poly-ether-imide (GF/PEI) composites were resistance-welded using a metal mesh heating element. The specimens were fatigue-tested at various percentages of their static lap shear strengths at a load ratio R = 0.1 and frequency f = 5 Hz. The fatigue performances of resistance-welded semi-crystalline (PEKK) and amorphous (PEI) composites were compared and the failure modes of the specimens were described. The stiffness degradation was monitored during the tests in order to evaluate the damage accumulation in the specimens. Linear stress-life (S-N) curves were obtained for all three materials when plotted on a semi-log scale. Interlaminar failure modes, involving tearing of the heating element and damage to the adherends were observed. The indefinite fatigue lives of CF/PEKK and CF/PEI welded specimens were obtained at 25{\%} of their static lap shear strengths. The indefinite fatigue life of the GF/PEI welded specimens was obtained at 20{\%} of the static lap shear strength. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Jin2013,
abstract = {An effective approach to reduce inter-particle gaps by nanofillers for making highly conductive polymer composites was reported based on the conductive tunnelling mechanism. A low percentage of nanosized conductive carbon filler (carbon black and graphite) or ions (Li+, Na+ and K +) was filled into the tunnelling phase of expanded graphite (EG) sheets, by which electron transport was enhanced across the junctions of EG sheets and a significant increase in the electrical conductivity of the composites was achieved. In this report, polyethylene (PE) and polyethersulphone (PES) were selected as model materials. The results indicated that for the EG/PE composite the conductive peculation threshold was less than 2 wt{\%} and its conductivity increased three orders of magnitude with the addition of only 1 wt{\%} nanofiller compared with the EG/PE composite. By introducing a very small amount of Li+ or Na+ (0.06 wt{\%} related to EG) the electrical conductivity was further enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to the EG/PES composite. Experimental results were well understood by the theoretical study of the electron transport behaviour in the EG/polymer composites. The gaps between graphite sheets in the matrix must be no larger than 10 nm if the EG/PE composite is to become electrically conductive. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Crevecoeur1991,
abstract = {Miscibility and crystallization behavior of blends of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and poly(ether imide) (PEI) were examined. The blends exhibit miscibility in the amorphous state over the entire composition range. Crystallization of PEEK is slower in the blends than in the pure compound. Upon crystallization, PEEK segregates from the miscible amorphous state, causing a shift in the composition of the amorphous phase. PEI is found to be located outside the crystalline lamellae of PEEK. Correspondingly, the crystallinity of PEEK in the crystallized blends does not change largely with composition.},
