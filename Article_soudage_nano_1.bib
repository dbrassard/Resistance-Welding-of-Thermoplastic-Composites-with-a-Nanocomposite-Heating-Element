abstract = {An experimental investigation of the resistance welding of carbon-fibre and glass-fibre reinforced polyetherimide laminates is presented. The optimum resistance welding time based on a criterion of maximum lap shear strength was determined. The time required to achieve intimate contact predicted by a three-dimensional transient finite-element model featuring heat transfer and consolidation correlated well with the optimal welding time. The influence of the welding pressure on lap shear strength was investigated, and the consolidation quality obtained in the welded joint was related to the processing conditions. The extent of flow occurring during welding, or the reduction of thickness of the welded joints, was shown to be related to lap shear strength. Four failure mechanisms, leading to different values of lap shear strength, were identi{\textregistered}ed including interfacial failure, cohesive failure of the heating element, tearing of the heating element and tearing of the laminate. Experimental and numerical processing windows were constructed and correlated well to each other. A comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements, in terms of lap shear strength and the interlaminar fracture toughness, GIc, was performed. It was demonstrated that large-scale lap-shear coupons and double cantilever beam specimens can be resistance welded providing that current leaking to the laminate is avoided.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation of resistance welding of APC-2/AS4 PEEK/carbon fibre composite using a stainless steel mesh heating element is presented. A special specimen geometry, the skin/stringer configuration, was used to represent a typical reinforced aerospace structural joint. The specimens consisted of a flange, representing a stringer or frame, welded onto a skin laminate. The effects of the welding parameters such as the input power level and clamping distance on the weld quality and performance were investigated. The welding parameters were optimised using short beam shear tests, ultrasonic C-scan inspection and optical microscopy. The mechanical performance of the resistance-welded skin/stringer configuration was investigated using three- and four-point bending tests and the failure mechanisms were characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Two methods were used to reduce the stress concentration at the flange tip. The first method was to machine a 20Â° taper angle at the edge of the flange and the second one was to create a resin fillet at the flange tip. No mechanical performance improvement was obtained with the resin fillet method but the taper angle method showed 25{\%} mechanical performance improvement when the taper angles were machined after the welding operation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A more homogeneous temperature distribution was generated by the metal mesh at the bonding surface. Glass fibre fabric reinforced PEI (GF/PEI) was used as an electrical insulator between the heating element and adherend laminates. Experimental results show that the GF/PEI prepreg could effectively prevent current leakage and enlarge the welding area. Welding parameters, such as input power level, welding time and pressure, were optimized according to the results of mechanical and microstructure characterization. Mechanical performance of composite specimens joined using metal mesh, in terms of lap shear strength and Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, was equivalent to that of compression moulded benchmarks. Fracture surfaces of welded specimens showed mostly cohesive failure or intralaminar failure, indicating that good bonding between the PEI matrix and metal mesh was achieved.},

Intralaminar failure was found to be the major failure mechanism for the well welded joints, consisting of either fibre-matrix debonding or laminate tearing. An improved fibre-matrix adhesion was found to result in significantly higher lap shear strength. Besides, the main apparent orientation of the fibres on the welding surfaces was found to have an effect on the strength of the joints. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{McKnight1997,
abstract = {Resistance welding has been demonstrated as a viable technique for joining thermoplastic composites. Extensive research has been conducted in previous studies on the processing and postprocessing evaluation of coupon-sized resistance welded specimens using this thermoplastic fusion bonding technique. This work focuses on the manufacturing and evaluation of large-scale resistance welds used to join carbon fiber (CF)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) thermoplastic composite parts. Applications using the present resistance welding technology are assessed, and potential applications of resistance welding are discussed. The sequential resistance welding process is introduced as an approach to large-scale welding that increases joint quality and performance while maintaining modest pressure and weld power requirements. The single-step and alternate multiple-step (sequential) techniques are implemented for large-scale resistance welds of CF/PEEK adherends comolded with polyetherimide (PEI) (i.e., the Thermabond{\textregistered} process). Nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, mechanical testing, fractography, and microscopy show that: (1) a higher weld uniformity was obtained with the multiple-step weld than the single-step weld; and (2) uneven heating and overheating were minimized by reducing the heating element length within the bond region through the use of the sequential resistance welding process. The different welding techniques produce a large variation in lap shear strength; direct comparison of the weld quality and lap shear strength shows that the sequential resistance welding process yields a superior bond. With the principles developed in this investigation, resistance welding can be used to join large-scale thermoplastic composite parts with consistent, high levels of performance and quality.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation characterising the fatigue failure mechanisms of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites skin/stringer joints is presented. Unidirectional (UD) and quasi-isotropic adherends were welded using stainless steel meshes as heating elements. The specimen geometry consisted of a flange laminate, representing a stringer, welded onto a skin laminate. In order to avoid current leakage to the electrically conductive adherends, a ceramic-coated heating element (TiO2 HE) was used for welding the UD specimens and some of the quasi-isotropic specimens. The fatigue performance of the welded joints was investigated under three-point bending. An indefinite fatigue life was obtained at 40{\%} and 35{\%} of the static damage initiation load for the UD and quasi-isotropic specimens, respectively. The failure mechanisms were documented based on observation of the fatigue cracks initiation and growth. UD specimens failed at the weld interface while quasi-isotropic specimens showed delaminations both in the flange or skin laminates and at the weld interface. The TiO2 HE did not show any fatigue mechanical performance reduction. However, debonding at the weld interface was shown to occur between the metal mesh wires and the TiO2 coating instead of between the laminates and the weld. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A hybrid interlayer made of a glass fibre (GF) fabric essentially impregnated with PEI on one side and with epoxy resin on the other side was produced to provide mechanical interlocking between the thermoplastic (TP) and the thermosetting (TS) systems. The 'optimal' resistance welding time based on the maximum lap shear strength (LSS) was determined for three power levels and correlated to the time required to achieve bonding predicted by the FEM. Consolidation quality and failure mechanisms were discussed in relation with processing parameters. Experimental and simulated processing windows were constructed and correlated to each other.

No single measurement tool provides a complete characterization; therefore, we summarize methods that include scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fast Fourier transform of high-resolution TEM, Raman spectroscopy, reflectance and thermogravimetric analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals information with regard to functional groups interacting the tube surface. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis is reviewed as the basis for evaluating specific surface area. We extend the review by presenting taxonomy of defects present in MWCNTs.
